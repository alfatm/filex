/**
 * e2e/run.mjs — the one entry point for filex's end-to-end suite.
 *
 * Four profiles, deliberately kept apart:
 *
 *   local        Hermetic Playwright run. Starts a filex binary on a free port
 *                against a throwaway data dir with a deterministic admin, waits
 *                for /healthz, runs every spec except the deployment smoke, and
 *                tears the whole thing down again. This is the release gate.
 *
 *   cypress      The SAME hermetic instance, driving web/cypress instead of
 *                Playwright. The two suites are not duplicates: Playwright
 *                walks user journeys through the UI, Cypress pins the HTTP
 *                contracts the UI is built on plus the admin screens that read
 *                them (web/cypress/README.md has the split). Both have to run
 *                with no secrets and against no live host.
 *
 *   app          The END-USER SPA (`app/`) against that same hermetic
 *                instance. It builds the app bundle with VITE_FILEX_API set
 *                and serves it with `vite preview`, whose `/api` proxy points
 *                at the server this run started — so the browser sees one
 *                origin and the session cookie needs no CORS.
 *
 *                It is the only coverage `app/` has: it exercises
 *                `app/src/data/http/` and its contract with the Go handlers,
 *                which is the code a deployment actually runs. A second suite
 *                once drove the app against an in-memory mock with no backend
 *                at all; it went when the mock did.
 *
 *   deployment   Read-only smoke against a URL that is already live. Never
 *                run as part of a build check.
 *
 * Mixing the live one into the others is what made the old setup unable to
 * answer the only question that matters before a release — "is this build
 * good?" — because a local run could go red merely because production was
 * slow. Keeping them separate is the point of this file.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node e2e/run.mjs local
 *   node e2e/run.mjs local --s3                 # + a MinIO container and an s3 storage
 *   node e2e/run.mjs local --binary ../bin/filex.exe --keep
 *   node e2e/run.mjs cypress
 *   node e2e/run.mjs cypress --spec "cypress/e2e/13-navigation-ui.cy.ts"
 *   node e2e/run.mjs app --build
 *   node e2e/run.mjs deployment --url https://fm.example.com
 *
 * Exit code is the suite's. A profile that cannot set up what it promised
 * fails loudly; it never quietly runs a smaller suite than you asked for.

 * One local-driver storage, so a browser suite measures a populated instance.

 *
 * ⚠ A bare instance has ZERO storages, and most of these specs discover "the
 * first storage" and then quietly do nothing when there is none. That run
 * reports green while asserting almost nothing — the failure mode this whole
 * exercise exists to remove. Seeding one deterministic storage is what makes
 * the pass/fail number mean something.
 *
 * ⚠ The root of a local storage is `config.path`, not `mount_path` and not
 * `config.root` — `local.Driver.Init` reads `path` first (e2e/helpers/seed.ts
 * carries the full story and the bug it caused). It lives under the throwaway
 * data dir so a run cannot inherit the previous one's files.
