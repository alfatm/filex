A single Go binary with a full-featured web UI, pluggable storage/auth/DB drivers,
**real-time collaboration**, **an embeddable web component**, a **desktop app with
background folder sync**, and a **built-in MCP server** so AI agents can drive it
natively.

## Try it now

**Live demo:** [demo.filex.sh](https://demo.filex.sh) — sign in with `demo@demo.com` / `demo`
(admin role, sandbox resets nightly). Or run your own in one line:

```bash
docker run -p 5212:5212 -v $(pwd)/data:/data ghcr.io/brf-tech/filex:latest
```

Open http://localhost:5212/admin — the first run prints admin credentials and embed
instructions to the console. That URL is the operator's; the people you give accounts to
get **http://localhost:5212/drive**, the same file manager without the panel around it.

Prefer a window over a browser tab? The **desktop app** (Windows / Linux / macOS) signs in
to any filex server and syncs folders in the background — and on every platform there is a
copy that runs **without being installed** (a portable `.exe`, an AppImage, a `.zip`):
[latest release](https://github.com/BRF-Tech/filex/releases/latest) ·
[docs/DESKTOP.md](docs/DESKTOP.md).

## Why filex

Most self-hosted file managers are either **too small** (a directory listing with uploads)
or **too big** (a groupware suite you deploy for the file tab). filex aims at the gap:

- **A browser client for your users, not just for you** — hand someone a `user` or
  `viewer` account and `…/drive` and they get the file manager itself: their storages,
  uploads, sharing, search, the editor. No admin panel to walk through, no separate
  frontend to deploy. `…/admin` is the operator's door to the same app.
- **Navigation people already know** — a left panel with a prominent **Upload** and
  **Recent · Starred · Shared with me · Trash**, plus the storages you can reach; a
  storage someone shared with you simply appears there, one click, no mount
  instructions. Anyone can collapse it to an icon rail, and `uiProfile: 'simple'`
  presets the rest of the chrome off — one pane, one folder, list or grid — for people
  who want a file drive rather than a file manager. **`uiProfile: 'drive'`** goes one
  step further and gives them the shell they already know: a single **+ New** menu,
  one search field across the header with its ⌘K palette hint, a Type / Modified /
  Size filter row, Folders and Files as labelled sections, Details and Activity in
  the info panel, and a storage line. One explorer in every case: there is no second
  UI to keep in step.
- **Embeds anywhere** — the same UI ships as a Vue 3 component, a React component and a
  framework-agnostic `<filex-explorer>` web component. Put a real file manager inside
  *your* product, backed by your own filex server and locked to a per-tenant folder.
  The navigation panel comes with it — `<filex-explorer sidenav ui-profile="simple">`
  is the whole opt-in for a host page that never touches JavaScript.
- **AI-agent-native** — a token-scoped REST surface (`/api/ai`) plus a native
  **MCP server** (`/api/ai/mcp`). Hand an agent a token confined to one folder and it can
  list, read, write, share and zip — nothing else.
- **Real-time** — presence avatars (a profile picture set once on the account, shown for
  every client signed in as you) and live file updates over WebSocket, in the native UI
  *and* in embedded contexts (short-lived ticket auth, API-polling fallback). A batch job
  is coalesced on the way out, so extracting a five-thousand-file archive costs an open
  explorer a bounded trickle of frames rather than five thousand
  ([docs/REALTIME.md](docs/REALTIME.md)).
- **On your desktop too** — the same explorer ships as a Windows/Linux/macOS app that keeps
  local folders in step with the server from the tray, updates itself, and holds several
  accounts (or tenants) side by side. Right-click a folder → **Keep on this computer** and
  it mirrors under one filex folder; everything else stays online-only in the window.
  Headless machines get the same engine as `filex sync` / `filex client`.
- **Speaks the protocols both ways** — filex can *connect to* local disks, S3, FTP, SFTP,
  WebDAV and SMB/NAS shares, and it can *be reached as* **S3**, **SFTP**, **FTPS**,
  **NFSv3** and **WebDAV**. Point `rclone`, `restic`, `aws s3`, WinSCP, FileZilla, a
  scanner that only learned FTP or a media player that only learned NFS at filex, and
  they land in the same tree, with the same permissions, the same trash and the same
  quota as the web UI. Off-LAN there is also **`filex mount`**, which attaches a remote
  server over ordinary HTTPS — a folder on Linux, a drive letter on Windows
  ([docs/PROTOCOLS.md](docs/PROTOCOLS.md)).
- **Multi-tenant by design** — storage-per-tenant with native tenancy mode, RBAC roles +
  per-item grants, confined API tokens, per-token identities for audit trails, and
  app-vs-user token kinds so a shared embed credential cannot manage anybody's keys.
- **Boringly deployable** — one binary or one container; SQLite by default, Postgres/MySQL
  when you want them; every driver switched by env vars.

## Self-host with Compose or Helm

The bare `docker run` above is enough to try filex out. For a real deployment,
ready-made stacks live in [`deploy/`](deploy/):

- **[`deploy/compose/`](deploy/compose/)** — Docker Compose:
  - **minimal** — filex + SQLite + local disk (one service, zero dependencies).
  - **full** — filex + PostgreSQL + Redis + Caddy (auto-HTTPS), plus toggleable
    add-ons: **OnlyOffice**, **Drawio**, universal **converter**, **MinIO** (S3).
    Turn each on/off with a Compose profile in `.env`.
- **[`deploy/helm/filex/`](deploy/helm/filex/)** — a Helm chart for Kubernetes
  (Deployment + PVC + optional Ingress). Every add-on above is an `enabled`
  toggle in `values.yaml` — bundle PostgreSQL / Redis / MinIO, or wire external
  OnlyOffice / Drawio / converter.

Step-by-step instructions for each tier are in
[docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## Embed in your app

### Vue 3
```bash
pnpm add @brftech/filex-core
```
```vue
<script setup>
import { FileExplorer } from '@brftech/filex-core';
import '@brftech/filex-core/style.css';
</script>
<template>
  <FileExplorer :config="{ apiBase: 'http://localhost:5212', auth: { kind: 'bearer', token: '…' } }" />
</template>
```

### React
```bash
pnpm add @brftech/filex-react
```
```jsx
import { FileManager } from '@brftech/filex-react';
<FileManager config={{ apiBase: 'http://localhost:5212' }} onError={(e) => console.error(e)} />
```

### Vanilla JS / any framework
```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@brftech/filex/dist/filex.js"></script>
<filex-explorer api-base="http://localhost:5212" sidenav connections ui-profile="simple"></filex-explorer>
```

`sidenav` turns the navigation panel on (it is on by default; the attribute is
there so a host page can state it either way), `connections` adds its "How to
connect" and "API keys" entries, and `ui-profile="simple"` presets the
power-user chrome off. All three are ordinary `config` keys, so the Vue and
React wrappers set them the same way — see
[docs/INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md).

Multi-tenant hosts typically proxy the API server-side, inject a **confined token**
(`root: tenant-folder`) per request, and strip client headers — the sandbox is enforced by
the backend, not the widget. Such a token is `kind: "app"`, so the panel hides the
surfaces that belong to one person — API keys, Recent, Starred, Shared with me —
while Upload, the storages, Trash and "How to connect" stay. See
[docs/INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md) and
[docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md#token-kinds--user-vs-app).

## Desktop app & CLI

The explorer also ships as a **Windows / Linux / macOS desktop app** — the same component
the web UI and the embeds render, not a separate half-copy:

- **Several accounts at once** — a rail of servers/tenants, each showing its own branding.
- **Drag files out** — drag a selection onto the desktop or into another app: folders and
  multi-selections arrive as separate real files and folders. Anything already kept on
  this computer drags instantly; the rest is fetched once and cached
  ([docs/DESKTOP.md](docs/DESKTOP.md#dragging-files-out)).
- **Keep on this computer** — right-click any folder, file or whole storage to mirror it
  under one filex folder on the machine (movable from Settings); everything else stays
  online-only, and every row says which it is (✓ ◐ ⟳ ☁). "Keep online only" hands the
  local copy back to the Trash, or leaves it
  ([docs/DESKTOP.md](docs/DESKTOP.md#keeping-folders-on-this-computer)).
- **Folder sync** — pair a local folder with a server folder and they stay in step both
  ways while the app sits in the tray: parallel transfers and listings, a first run that
  resumes where it was interrupted, 30-day local trash, and an engine that refuses to
  turn a missing folder into a mass delete ([docs/SYNC.md](docs/SYNC.md)).
- **Opens Office documents off your own disk** — double-click a `.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx`
  (or any of the ten Office types) and it opens in the editor your server runs, on a
  machine with no Office installed. A document inside a folder you keep on this computer
  opens as itself; anything else is copied up, edited, and written back over the original
  ([docs/DESKTOP.md](docs/DESKTOP.md#opening-documents-from-your-computer)).
- **Signs in through your browser**, so SSO and MFA behave exactly as they do on the web.
- **Updates itself** — downloads quietly, installs on quit; `FILEX_NO_UPDATE=1` opts out.
- **Runs without being installed**, if that is what you need: the Windows **portable**
  `.exe`, the Linux AppImage and the macOS `.zip` all run from wherever you put them. The
  portable Windows copy keeps everything it has in one `filex-data` folder beside itself,
  so deleting that folder leaves nothing of yours on a machine that is not yours — the
  trade is that it does not update itself.

Installer, portable `.exe`, AppImage, `.deb` and `.dmg` are attached to the
[latest release](https://github.com/BRF-Tech/filex/releases/latest) — not code-signed yet,
so expect a SmartScreen prompt on Windows. Details: [docs/DESKTOP.md](docs/DESKTOP.md).

The same binary is also a client for servers, scripts and headless machines:

```bash
filex client login --url https://files.example.com
filex client upload build/report.pdf docs://ci-artifacts/

filex sync add ~/Documents/work docs://work   # the engine the desktop app uses
filex sync run --watch 30s
```

See [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md) and [docs/SYNC.md](docs/SYNC.md).

## AI agents / MCP

filex ships a token-authenticated automation surface at `/api/ai` (list, read, write,
move, delete, search, share, zip) and speaks **Model Context Protocol** at `/api/ai/mcp`:

```bash
claude mcp add filex --transport http https://files.example.com/api/ai/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <api-token>"
```

Tokens are scoped by verb (`read,write,delete,share`), optionally **confined to a single
folder**, gated by the same RBAC grants as the UI, and stamped with per-token identities
so audit logs, shares and presence show *who* (which integration) did what.

A large file already on the agent's disk never fits through a tool call — its bytes would
have to travel through the model's context. **Upload tickets** fix that: one authorized
call pins the destination and returns a short-lived, single-use URL that needs **no
credentials**, so even an agent with no filex token can finish the transfer with
`curl -T bigfile <url>`. Details: [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md).

## Features

- **Multi-storage** — mount many storages at once (local, S3, FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, SMB/NAS); each appears as a top-level folder. **Copy or cut in one and paste in another**: filex streams the tree between the two drivers, keeps each file's timestamp, and only removes the original once the copy is verified.
- **Drag files out to your desktop** — in the desktop app, drag a selection into Explorer/Finder or another program and it lands as separate real files and folders, not an archive; in a browser, a single file drags out the same way ([docs/DESKTOP.md](docs/DESKTOP.md#dragging-files-out)).
- **Storage plugins** — a storage filex has never heard of is a **separate program** you install from the admin panel: it describes its own config form, filex speaks a small HTTP/JSON protocol to it, and its driver then behaves like any built-in one. Any language; a Go SDK makes it three methods. filex **probes every capability a plugin claims** — at install, and again against the configuration you type when you save a storage on it — and refuses one that cannot do what it says, because a half-working driver produces failures that look like filex being broken. Upgrades replace the binary in place and roll back if the new one does not come up ([docs/PLUGINS.md](docs/PLUGINS.md)).
- **Protocol gateway** — the same tree is reachable as **S3** (SigV4; aws-cli, rclone, restic, mc, s3fs), **SFTP** (OpenSSH, WinSCP, FileZilla, sshfs), **FTPS** (explicit TLS, for the equipment that only learned FTP; hand it your reverse proxy's auto-renewing certificate — it is re-read on change), **NFSv3** (LAN NAS clients, media players) and **WebDAV** — each with its own credential you can revoke on its own, and all of them behind the same permissions, trash and quota as the UI ([docs/PROTOCOLS.md](docs/PROTOCOLS.md)).
- **`filex mount`** — attach a remote filex server to a folder over ordinary HTTPS: a folder on Linux, a **drive letter on Windows** (`filex mount Z:`, needs the free [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev)). Not a sync: nothing is copied but a bounded read cache, so it opens one file out of a hundred thousand without downloading the rest.
- **Real-time collaboration** — presence bar with live avatars + focus, instant file-change updates over WebSocket, polling fallback. One write is announced the moment it lands; a burst (a zip extraction, a folder upload, an NFS client writing chunk after chunk) is merged into one frame per window so the folder stays live without flooding the page ([docs/REALTIME.md](docs/REALTIME.md)).
- **RBAC + item permissions** — roles, per-file/folder grants with inheritance, share invites by e-mail (SMTP), grant-aware search and listings. **Shared with me** answers the reverse question from the recipient's side — what other people granted you, and which storages you reach only through a grant.
- **Drive shell (`uiProfile: 'drive'`)** — the end-user layout, and a preset of the same explorer rather than a second one: a primary **+ New** menu (upload files · new folder · request files), one **search field in the header** whose ⌘K / Ctrl+K chip hands the query to the command palette (the field searches this folder; the palette is where "everywhere", saved searches and commands live), a **Type · Modified · Size** filter row under the breadcrumb, **Folders** and **Files** as labelled sections in grid view, an info panel split into **Details** (with "People with access" and a share-link row) and **Activity** (version history and comments), and a **storage line** under the navigation. Density, theme, the shortcut editor and the other view modes stay one click away in the header's "⋯" menu — nothing is removed from the build ([docs/INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md)).
- **Navigation panel** — Upload as the primary action, the views Recent / Starred / Shared with me / Trash, the storages you can see, and **How to connect** + **API keys**: the per-protocol guides and the self-service token manager, opened from inside the explorer so an embedded copy's users can mint the credential WebDAV/FTPS/`filex mount` ask for instead of asking an administrator. Collapsible to an icon rail (remembered per browser), a drawer instead of a column under 560px. On by default in the web app, the desktop app and every embed; `uiProfile: 'simple'` additionally turns off the tab strip, the split pane, the gallery view mode and the "How to connect" surface without removing any of them from the build ([docs/INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md)).
- **Sharing** — public links with PIN, expiry and max-downloads, under an admin-set **maximum link life** (default 7 days — the dialog only offers what the server will keep); folder links stream as ZIP (cached, pre-warmed up to a size ceiling, swept after a week); **file-request** upload links for inbound drops; ShareX-compatible upload endpoint ([docs/SHARING.md](docs/SHARING.md)).
- **Desktop app + folder sync** — Windows/Linux/macOS app: tray-resident two-way sync, **selective sync** (right-click → *Keep on this computer*, one root folder per account, the rest online-only), several accounts at once, **opens Office documents from your own disk** in the server's editor, self-updating (macOS: unsigned build, updates by re-download until it is signed) ([docs/DESKTOP.md](docs/DESKTOP.md), [docs/SYNC.md](docs/SYNC.md)).
- **Trash & version history** — deletes are reversible within a retention window, writes keep snapshots; both live in the storage you already mounted ([docs/TRASH-VERSIONING.md](docs/TRASH-VERSIONING.md)).
- **Write protection** — optional ClamAV scanning of every file written — the built-in editor included, and files the storage sync finds on the backend rather than through filex — reached through a local binary or a clamd container over the network; plus trash/version retention behind one admin surface. The switch, the scanner mode and address, the size ceiling and the editor save-scan window live on **Settings → Protection**; the `FILEX_CLAMAV*` variables seed them on a first boot and then step aside (the scanner's binary path stays environment-only, deliberately — it is a command this server executes) ([docs/PROTECTION.md](docs/PROTECTION.md)).
- **E2E encrypted folders** — client-side WebCrypto; the server stores ciphertext and never receives a key. Each folder gets a **recovery key**, shown once, so a forgotten password is not automatically lost data; an operator can optionally enable **key escrow** — at install, or adopted later on a running installation; it never reaches existing folders on its own, but their owners are offered the choice at unlock — and its use notifies the folder's owner ([docs/E2E-ENCRYPTION.md](docs/E2E-ENCRYPTION.md)).
- **Native multi-tenancy** — provider/tenant mode with per-tenant isolation on one instance ([docs/MULTI-TENANCY.md](docs/MULTI-TENANCY.md)).
- **Driver-pluggable everything** — storage / auth / DB / queue drivers opt-in via env (`FILEX_AUTH_DRIVERS=local,oidc`, `FILEX_QUEUE_DRIVER=postgres`, …).
- **OIDC SSO-first** — optional auto-redirect to your IdP with break-glass local login (`?local=1`).
- **LDAP / Active Directory** — directory accounts sign in on the same password form as local ones, and on WebDAV/SFTP/FTPS/S3/NFS too; private-CA support, and `local` stays first so `admin@local` works while the directory is down ([docs/LDAP.md](docs/LDAP.md)).
- **Replica + reconciliation** — primary→replica fan-out (mirror / append-only / skip per path-glob rule), read fallback, scheduled status report, one-click "Fix all".
- **Persistent op queue** — restart-safe queue (SQLite / Redis / Postgres), worker pool with retries + cancel + admin dashboard. All three drivers order by priority, so the antivirus scan for a file somebody just uploaded is served ahead of the twenty thousand a first import queued.
- **DB-backed file tree** — listings come from the DB cache (1-5 ms), not the storage backend (~100 ms); a periodic sync catches out-of-band changes, by etag where the backend reports one and by size + modification time where it does not.
- **Viewers & editors** — image/video/audio, PDF, Markdown (split editor + preview), CSV, code (Monaco), Office via OnlyOffice, Drawio + Mermaid diagrams, 3D models.
- **Universal converter** — optional side-car converts between document/image formats from the UI. It, OnlyOffice and drawio are configured in the admin panel and apply to the running server, with no restart ([docs/ONLYOFFICE.md](docs/ONLYOFFICE.md), [docs/CONVERT-INTEGRATION.md](docs/CONVERT-INTEGRATION.md)).
- **Notifications** — generic JSON webhooks (Slack/Discord-agnostic): any number of targets, each with its own signing secret and its own per-event subscription, plus an in-app bell with read/unread and a per-user mute matrix. A write that **creates** a file and a write that **replaces** one are different events (`file.uploaded` / `file.updated`), and the ones an operator most wants on their own — an infected upload quarantined, a failed upload, an encrypted folder opened with its recovery key — are subscribable individually ([docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md](docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md)).
- **Search** — Bleve embedded, full-text + metadata, permission-aware. VS Code-style filename scoring: folders count and word order does not (`main code` finds `Code/main.go`), separators and typos forgiven (`invoice 2026` finds `invoice_2026.pdf`, `mian.go` finds `main.go`) while numbers are matched literally (`2026` never means `2025`), `tag:` filters, exact matches ranked first.
- **Thumbnails** — image, video (ffmpeg), PDF (ghostscript), Office (a LibreOffice conversion service, not bundled — see [docs/thumbnails.md](docs/thumbnails.md#the-office-conversion-service)); capability-aware. A cached thumbnail is released when the file it belongs to is deleted for good, and a periodic reconciler reclaims the orphans an older install accumulated ([docs/thumbnails.md](docs/thumbnails.md)).
- **Tabs, themes & deep links** — several folders open side by side, light/dark/auto theme, and an address bar that tracks the open folder so a pasted link lands there.
- **Audit log** — every mutation recorded with actor, integration identity and metadata.
- **CLI client** — the same binary reaches a remote server (`filex client`, `filex sync`) with no server-side plugin ([docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md)).
- **Self-updating** — patch releases install themselves, minor ones are announced for one-click upgrade ([docs/UPDATES.md](docs/UPDATES.md)).
- **Single binary** — goreleaser matrix: linux/macOS/Windows × amd64/arm64. CGO=0, modernc.org/sqlite.
- **i18n** — English + Turkish out of the box, **public pages included**: a
  share link, a PIN gate or a file-request page renders in the visitor's
  language (`?lang=`, then `Accept-Language`, then the server default).

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BRF-Tech/filex.git
cd filex
pnpm install
pnpm run build:all    # builds packages, web, then Go binary
./bin/filex serve
```

Live dev servers (Vite + `go run` in parallel):

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # then fill in FILEX_SECRET_KEY and friends
pnpm dlx dotenv-cli -e .env -- pnpm dev
```

Neither pnpm nor the Go backend reads `.env` on its own, so plain `pnpm dev`
starts with an empty `FILEX_SECRET_KEY` and the assistant refuses to store
provider keys. The `dotenv-cli` prefix exports `.env` into the environment that
every workspace `dev` script inherits.

Subdirectories:
- `backend/` — Go HTTP service (cmd/filex, internal/*, db/queries, db/migrations)
- `packages/core` — `@brftech/filex-core` (Vue 3 SFC, source of truth)
- `packages/webcomponent` — `@brftech/filex` (Web Component wrapper)
- `packages/react` — `@brftech/filex-react` (React adapter via @lit/react)
- `web/` — Vue 3 admin UI (embedded into Go binary via `go:embed`)
- `desktop/` — Electron app (bundled main process, tray sync, auto-update)
- `demo/` — Standalone HTML demos for each framework
- `e2e/` — Playwright suites (web, embeds, packaged desktop app) + `shots/`, the
  script that retakes the screenshots above
- `docker/` — Dockerfiles + compose
- `deploy/` — ready-made Compose stacks + Helm chart (see [`deploy/`](deploy/))
