### Auth markers

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ![public](https://img.shields.io/badge/-public-lightgrey) | No auth |
| ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)         | Any authenticated user |
| ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)         | Admin role required |

Auth is provided either by a session cookie (`filex_session`) or a Bearer
token (`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`). Both are accepted on the same routes.

---

## Auth & sessions

### `POST /api/auth/login` ![public](https://img.shields.io/badge/-public-lightgrey)
Local-driver password login.

**Request**
```json
{ "email": "admin@local", "password": "kT9_x4Pq2Nm-BvLs" }
```
**Response 200**
```json
{
  "user": { "id": 1, "email": "admin@local", "username": "admin", "role": "admin" },
  "token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "expires_at": "2026-05-05T12:00:00Z"
}
```
The session cookie is set by the same response. The Bearer token is for SPA
embeds that prefer header auth.

**Status codes:** `200` ok · `401` invalid creds · `429` rate-limited.

### `POST /api/auth/logout` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Invalidates the session cookie / token.

### `GET /api/auth/oidc/start` ![public](https://img.shields.io/badge/-public-lightgrey)
Redirects (302) the browser to the configured OIDC issuer authorise URL.

**Query**: `?next=/path/to/return/to` (optional)

### `GET /api/auth/oidc/callback` ![public](https://img.shields.io/badge/-public-lightgrey)
OIDC redirect target. Validates `code`, exchanges for tokens, creates/updates
the user, sets the session cookie, redirects to `next`.

### `GET /api/auth/me` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
**Response 200**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1, "email": "admin@local", "username": "admin",
    "role": "admin", "groups": ["filex-admin"],
    "avatar_url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,…"
  }
}
```

### `PATCH /api/auth/profile` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Patches the caller's own `email`, `display_name`, `locale`, `timezone` and
`avatar_url`. Absent fields are left alone.

`avatar_url` is the **profile picture**: a `data:image/…` URI (≤ 48 KB) or an
`http(s)` / site-relative URL; an explicit `""` removes it. Anything else is a
`400` rather than a silent drop — the person is looking at an upload they
believe worked. The admin SPA's profile page downscales what you pick to 160px
before encoding, so the cap is not something a user meets.

The picture belongs to the **account**, which is what makes it appear
everywhere: the explorer's collaboration strip draws it instead of initials for
that user on every client of the account — browser session, desktop app, and any
API key minted under it. Two deliberate exceptions, because the alternative is
drawing the wrong face on somebody's row:

- A token with a **username allow-list** is a shared proxy, not a person (its
  presence entry reads "work"), so no picture is attached.
- When a trusted host proxy re-identifies a connection as a different end user
  via `X-Filex-Presence-Name`, only *that* person's picture may be drawn —
  supplied by the proxy as `X-Filex-Presence-Avatar` (same accepted shapes, same
  cap). Without it the row falls back to initials.

The cap is small on purpose: the avatar rides inside every presence frame the
collaboration socket broadcasts, so it is paid for again on each join, leave and
focus change — unlike the branding logo, which is fetched once per page.

---

## Capabilities

### `GET /api/capabilities` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Tells the frontend what features are available — used to hide buttons for
disabled features.

**Response 200** (abridged — the real body also carries the per-storage probe,
build metadata and a set of flat aliases kept for older embeds)
```json
{
  "version": "0.34.0",
  "upload": true, "move": true, "copy": true, "delete": true, "mkdir": true,
  "search": true, "versions": true, "ocr": false,
  "thumbs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "image": true, "video": true, "pdf": true, "office": false
  },
  "antivirus": true,
  "antivirus_mode": "daemon",
  "external": {
    "onlyoffice": { "enabled": true, "url": "https://docs.example.com", "state": "ok" },
    "drawio":     { "enabled": false, "url": "", "state": "" },
    "convert":    { "enabled": false, "url": "", "state": "" }
  },
  "onlyoffice_url": "https://docs.example.com",
  "drawio_url": "",
  "convert_url": "",
  "max_upload_size": 5368709120,
  "chunk_size": 8388608,
  "auth_drivers": ["local", "oidc"],
  "storage_drivers": ["ftp", "local", "s3", "sftp", "smb", "webdav"],
  "db_driver": "sqlite",
  "share_max_ttl_days": 7
}
```
Cached client-side for 1h. `share_max_ttl_days` is the longest life a new share
link may be given (0 = no ceiling; [PROTECTION.md](PROTECTION.md)).

⚠ `antivirus` means **configured**, not answering: the setting is on and either
a scanner binary resolved or a clamd address is set. Reachability costs a
network round trip and is probed on `GET /api/admin/protection`, where an
operator is waiting for the answer. `antivirus_mode` is `binary` or `daemon`
and is absent when `antivirus` is false — the two deployments produce the same
green light and behave very differently when one of them breaks.

---

## File browsing

### `GET /api/files/manager` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
List the contents of a directory.

**Query**
| Param  | Type   | Default | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| `path` | string | `/`     | URL-encoded; e.g. `/storage1/sub/folder` |
| `sort` | enum   | `name`  | `name \| size \| modified` |
| `dir`  | enum   | `asc`   | `asc \| desc` |
| `limit`| int    | `1000`  | max items per page |
| `offset`| int   | `0`     | pagination offset |

**Response 200**
```json
{
  "path": "/storage1/sub",
  "entries": [
    {
      "name": "report.pdf", "type": "file", "size": 102400,
      "modified": "2026-04-22T10:00:00Z",
      "mime": "application/pdf",
      "etag": "abc123",
      "is_image": false, "is_video": false, "thumb_url": "/api/files/thumb?token=...",
      "id": 4711
    },
    {
      "name": "photos", "type": "dir", "size": 0,
      "modified": "2026-04-23T08:00:00Z", "id": 4712
    }
  ],
  "total": 2,
  "storage": { "name": "storage1", "driver": "s3", "readonly": false }
}
```

**Status codes:** `200` ok · `403` forbidden · `404` path missing.

### Filenames in `Content-Disposition`

Every endpoint that serves bytes (`action=download` / `preview`, share
downloads, the share browser, the viewer) sends RFC 6266:

```
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="T_rk_e adl_ dosya.txt"; filename*=UTF-8''T%C3%BCrk%C3%A7e%20adl%C4%B1%20dosya.txt
```

⚠ The header is **always pure ASCII**. A raw non-ASCII byte in a header value is
outside the specification, and while browsers cope, strict clients throw while
parsing the response — Electron's `net.fetch` raises
`Cannot convert argument to a ByteString …` from inside its response handler,
which no caller's try/catch can catch. The ASCII `filename` is the fallback;
`filename*` carries the real name and is what every current browser uses.

### `GET /api/files/raw?path=…` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Stream the raw file bytes. Sends `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, and
honours `Range:` for partial GETs (video / audio scrub).

### `POST /api/files/move` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
**Request** — sources and the destination FOLDER, both adapter-qualified.
`sourceDir` is where the drag/cut came from (it stamps the undo).
```json
{
  "source": ["alpha://a.txt", "alpha://klasor"],
  "target": "beta://hedef",
  "sourceDir": "alpha://"
}
```
**Response 202** `{ "op": { "id": 12, "kind": "move", "storage_id": 1, "dest_storage_id": 2, … } }`
— the work is queued; poll `GET /api/files/ops`.

### `POST /api/files/copy` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Same shape, same queued answer.

**The two ends may live in different storages.** `dest_storage_id` on the queued
op is the target's storage; when it differs from `storage_id`, the worker
streams the bytes between the two drivers instead of asking one driver to
rename — a whole tree, empty folders included, each file's mtime preserved where
the target can hold one, and every file stat-checked on the far side before a
move deletes anything. A cross-storage move removes the source outright (not to
the trash); a name already taken becomes `name-copy`. Full behaviour:
[Moving files between storages](STORAGE.md#moving-files-between-storages).

**Refusals** are at submit time, not in the worker: `400` unknown target adapter
· `403` read-only target storage (with a `hint`) · `403` read-only SOURCE storage
for move and delete, which take bytes away from it (copy only reads, so it is
allowed) · `403` no editor permission on the source, or on the target folder
**in the destination's storage** · `400` mixed-adapter *sources* (one batch, one
source storage).

⚠ Before v0.27.0 the destination's `<adapter>://` prefix was dropped and the
remaining relative path applied to the SOURCE storage, so a cross-storage paste
answered `202` and wrote the file into the depo it was copied from.

### Search facets
`POST /api/files/search` also takes the filter half of a query. All optional;
each one narrows, none widens.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `path_prefix` | Confine to one subtree, storage-relative (`/Docs/2026`). This is "search in the current folder". |
| `ext` | Extensions without the dot (`["md","pdf"]`). **Extensions, not a type-group name** — which extensions count as "documents" is the client's vocabulary, and a second copy of that taxonomy here is a second copy to keep in step. |
| `modified_after` | Epoch milliseconds. |
| `size_min` / `size_max` | Bytes. `size_max: 0` means no ceiling. |
| `owner_id` | filex's numeric user id. |
| `dirs_only` | Answer with **folders** and nothing else. The destination picker's filter box: its tree loads a level at a time, so without this the box could only search the levels somebody had already opened — which is the same as not having one. |

`ext`, `size_min` and `size_max` imply files only — a folder has no extension
and its size is a rollup. A date or an owner keeps folders. `dirs_only` is the
mirror of that implication and overrides it: asking for folders *and* for an
extension is a contradiction, and it is answered with nothing rather than by
quietly keeping one half.

**Why they are not applied to the answer.** The full-text index knows a
document's name, path, mime and type and nothing else, so a filtered search used
to mean "the first N hits for the text, minus the ones that did not fit": if the
files the user wanted ranked two hundredth, they saw nothing and could not tell
that from "there are none". The facets are resolved against the node table and
applied as a restriction on which documents the index may return — the same
mechanism `tag:` uses — plus an exact pass over the results, which is what makes
them right on the two paths that never consult the index (a bare `tag:` listing
and the SQL LIKE fallback).

⚠ The id set behind the restriction is capped at 10 000 per storage, as `tag:`
is and for the same reason: the ids become a boolean query inside the index.
Past the cap the answer carries `"facets_truncated": true` — the filter became a
sample, so a hit outside it cannot be found however well it matches.

A search with no `storage_id` resolves the facets against every enabled storage
and unions them; the RBAC pass at the end drops whatever the caller may not see,
as it does for any hit.

### `POST /api/files/ops` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
The unified form behind the three per-verb endpoints:
```json
{ "kind": "copy", "storage_id": 1, "dest_storage_id": 2,
  "sources": ["a.txt"], "dest": "hedef/" }
```
`dest_storage_id` may be omitted or `0`, which means "the sources' storage".

### `POST /api/files/mkdir` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
```json
{ "path": "/storage1/new-folder" }
```

### `POST /api/files/rename` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
```json
{ "path": "/storage1/old.txt", "new_name": "new.txt" }
```

### `POST /api/files/delete` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Same shape and same queued answer as move and copy — one verb, one queue.
```json
{ "source": ["alpha://a.txt", "alpha://klasor"] }
```
**Response 202** `{ "op": { "id": 14, "kind": "delete", … } }`; poll
`GET /api/files/ops/{id}`.

**This is the move to trash, not a purge.** The worker runs the same `trash.Put`
the synchronous `?q=delete` runs: the bytes are renamed into `.filex-trash/` and
the row keeps its id, so `POST /api/files/manager/restore` can put it back.
A driver that can neither move nor copy has nothing to preserve with, and only
there is the delete a real one. Purging is the admin's `/api/admin/trash/*`.

**Refusals** are the same submit-time ones as move, minus the destination:
`403` read-only source storage · `403` no editor permission on a source ·
`400` mixed-adapter sources · `400` a source that names a storage root.

### `DELETE /api/files/manager/trash/:id` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Destroy one entry of the caller's OWN trash. `200 { ok: true }`.

The admin route beside it (`DELETE /api/admin/trash/{id}`) takes any entry in the
deployment; this one takes only what the caller could have deleted in the first
place — confinement on the entry's ORIGINAL path, ≥editor there — which is what
makes it safe to hand to an ordinary account.

**A node that is not in the trash answers `404`**, live rows included. The purge
takes the bytes at the row's current path, and for a live row that path is where
the file still is.

### `POST /api/files/manager/trash/empty` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Destroy everything in the trash this caller may purge.
```json
{ "ok": true, "purged": 12, "failed": 0, "skipped": 0, "more": false }
```
Top-level entries only — purging a deleted folder already takes its contents —
capped at 500 per request so no single call holds open for a trash of any size.
`more` says the cap was reached; ask again. An entry the caller may not purge is
`skipped`, not refused: on a shared drive, somebody else's deletion must not make
"empty my trash" fail altogether. A caller that keeps getting `purged: 0` has
purged everything it may.

### `GET /api/files/activity` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
What has happened to ONE file. `?path=<adapter>://<rel>&limit=50` (50 is both
the default and the ceiling — a details panel shows a short history; the long
one is the admin audit page).
```json
{ "events": [
  { "id": 23, "event": "file.moved", "at": "2026-09-07T19:26:20Z",
    "actor_id": 1, "actor_name": "Ada Lovelace",
    "meta": { "from": "/Docs/act.txt", "to": "/Docs/gunluk.txt", "origin": "manager" } }
] }
```
Readable by whoever may read the file (≥viewer, plus root confinement). A caller
without that gets `403`, not an empty list — an empty list would answer whether
the file exists.

The rows are the canonical file events every write surface already emits, read
back the other way round. `meta` is the event's own payload, which is what tells
a rename from a move without a second vocabulary here; `actor` and `node` are
lifted out into fields.

⚠ **Keyed by path**, because that is what the event carries. A renamed file has
its history split across the two names — the events from before the rename stay
under the old one. Same property every path-addressed surface in filex has.

⚠ **History starts at the upgrade.** Migration 00034 added the columns that make
an event findable per node and deliberately did not backfill them from
`meta_json`: parsing every existing row would spend a long migration on events
nothing could have shown anyway.

### `GET /api/files/manager/shared-with-me` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)

What other people have shared with the caller — the items they reach through a
per-item grant rather than their own role. Newest grant first.

| Param | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `limit` | `100` | Page size, max 500. |
| `offset` | `0` | Page offset. |

```json
{ "files": [ /* listing entries, same shape as /api/files/manager */ ],
  "storages": ["marketing"], "total": 2, "limit": 100, "offset": 0 }
```

Each entry carries `perm` (the grant's level), `shared: true` and `shared_at`.
A grant on a folder lists **the folder**, not its contents — the row is a `dir`
whose `path` is adapter-qualified, so opening it navigates in the ordinary way.
`storages` names the storages the caller reaches only through a grant: those are
the "shared drives", and a storage-wide grant is reported there rather than as a
row with an empty name. Results are filtered by tenant scope and by the caller's
root confinement. See [RBAC.md](RBAC.md).

### `GET /api/files/search?q=…` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Bleve full-text + metadata search. Same response shape as `/api/files/manager`
but with `path` echoing the matching entry's full path.

| Param | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `q` (or `query`) | — | Search text. May carry `tag:x` / `-tag:x` filters. |
| `storage_id` | `0` (all) | Restrict to one storage. Also what enables the SQL LIKE fallback. |
| `limit` | `50` | Max results. |
| `scope` | `all` | `name` \| `content` \| `all`. |

`POST /api/files/search` takes the same fields as a JSON body. Hits come back in
a defined rank order — exact filename, prefix, name, path, fuzzy, then
content-only. Full reference: [SEARCH.md](SEARCH.md).

### `POST /api/files/save-text` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Writes the body of the built-in text / code / Markdown editor. Takes a version
snapshot of what it is about to replace, writes the bytes, updates the row and
re-indexes the file.

⚠ Creating and saving are **different events** and get **different scans**:

| | event | antivirus |
|---|---|---|
| the path has no row yet | `file.uploaded` | scanned **immediately**, like an upload |
| the path already holds a file | `file.updated` | **one** scan scheduled `antivirus.save_scan_window_minutes` out; further saves inside that window join it rather than rescheduling, and it reads the file as it stands *then* |

So a burst of Ctrl+S costs exactly one scan, and the window cannot be pushed
out indefinitely by somebody who keeps typing. The delay is a row in the
operation queue, not a timer in the process, so it survives a restart. See
[PROTECTION.md → Files written in the editor](PROTECTION.md#files-written-in-the-editor).

---

## Uploads (multipart)

For files >5 MB. Smaller files can use `POST /api/files/upload` (single-shot
`multipart/form-data`).

### `POST /api/files/upload/init` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
**Request**
```json
{
  "storage_id": 1,
  "path": "storage1://big.iso",
  "filename": "big.iso",
  "size": 5368709120,
  "mime": "application/octet-stream",
  "chunk_bytes": 16777216
}
```
`storage_id` may be omitted when `path` carries an adapter prefix; `filename` is
optional and folded onto `path` when both are sent (an upload to a storage root
arrives as `path: "adapter://"` plus a filename). `chunk_bytes` is a request:
the server raises anything below 5 MiB and re-balances so an upload never
exceeds 10 000 parts — **use the `part_size` it answers with**.

**Response 200**
```json
{
  "upload_id": "u_AbCdEf",
  "part_urls": [
    "https://s3.example.com/...&partNumber=1&X-Amz-Sig=...",
    "https://s3.example.com/...&partNumber=2&X-Amz-Sig=..."
  ],
  "part_size": 16777216,
  "part_count": 320,
  "expires_at": "2026-04-29T00:00:00Z"
}
```
`part_urls` is a **flat list of URLs**, one per part in order — the browser PUTs
each chunk straight to its own URL, then calls `/finalize` (or `/abort`).

> ⚠ There is **no chunk-through-filex fallback on this endpoint**. A driver that
> cannot do multipart at all (local, sftp, ftp, webdav) answers
> **`501 storage does not support multipart upload`** at `init` — earlier
> versions of this page described a `POST /api/files/upload/chunk` route as the
> fallback; that route does not exist. Measured 2026-08-19.

> ⚠⚠ A [plugin](PLUGINS.md) storage that declares `multipart` passes the check
> at `init` and then usually answers **no part URLs** (`part_urls: null`),
> because a plugin's multipart is built for the staged-upload commit, where
> filex pushes the parts itself. There is nothing for the browser to PUT to —
> use the staged path for plugin storages.

> ⚠ This whole endpoint is the **older** browser-chunked path, kept for older
> embedders. No filex client speaks it any more: the staged path
> ([UPLOADS.md](UPLOADS.md)) replaced it everywhere, works on every driver, and
> is the only one that can resume.

### `POST /api/files/upload/finalize` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
```json
{
  "upload_id": "u_AbCdEf",
  "etags": [
    { "part": 1, "etag": "..." },
    { "part": 2, "etag": "..." }
  ]
}
```
**Response 200** `{ "id": 99, "path": "/storage1/big.iso", "size": 5368709120, "etag": "..." }`

### `POST /api/files/upload/abort` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
```json
{ "upload_id": "u_AbCdEf" }
```
Cancels the upload and discards staged chunks.

---

## Archives

Server-side zip handling. Limited to `FILEX_LIMITS_MAX_ARCHIVE_BYTES`
(default 1 GiB).

### `GET /api/files/download/zip` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)

Streams any mix of files and folders as one archive — what a browser's
"Download" does with a folder or a multi-selection.

```
GET /api/files/download/zip?path=main://Design&path=main://notes.md&name=stuff.zip
```

| Param | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `path` | repeated, once per selected file or folder; folders are walked recursively |
| `name` | optional archive filename; defaults to `<basename>.zip` for a single path, `files.zip` for several |

A GET with the paths in the query string, not a POST with a body, because the
download has to be a navigation for the browser to own its save dialog, its
progress and its disk write. At most 500 paths.

Each root is resolved, confinement-checked, authorised (≥viewer) and stat'ed
**before** the first byte, since the status line is 200 from the moment a zip
header is written. Members inside a subtree the caller may not see are skipped,
the way a folder listing skips them. A read error deep inside a folder can only
end the stream, leaving a short file — there is no way to change the status by
then.

### `POST /api/files/archive/list` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
**Request**
```json
{ "path": "/storage1/archive.zip" }
```
**Response 200**
```json
{
  "entries": [
    { "name": "a.txt", "size": 100, "is_dir": false, "modified": "..." },
    { "name": "sub/", "size": 0, "is_dir": true, "modified": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /api/files/archive/extract` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
```json
{
  "path": "/storage1/archive.zip",
  "dest": "/storage1/extracted/",
  "overwrite": false
}
```
Returns `202 + { operation_id: "op_..." }` and runs in background.

### `POST /api/files/archive/add` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
```json
{
  "paths": ["/storage1/a.txt", "/storage1/sub/"],
  "dest": "/storage1/bundle.zip",
  "compression": "deflate"
}
```
Returns `202 + { operation_id: "op_..." }`.

---

## Sharing

PIN-protected, time-limited, optionally download-capped public links.

### `POST /api/files/share` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
**Request**
```json
{
  "path": "/storage1/report.pdf",
  "ttl": "168h",
  "max_downloads": 10,
  "pin": "1234",
  "comment": "for the auditors"
}
```
**Response 200**
```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "url": "https://files.example.com/s/Xy3kPq",
  "token": "Xy3kPq",
  "expires_at": "2026-05-05T12:00:00Z",
  "expiry_clamped": false,
  "max_downloads": 10
}
```

`expires_at` is what was **stored**, not what was asked: every new link is
capped at the admin's maximum link life (`share.max_ttl_days`, default 7 days —
[PROTECTION.md](PROTECTION.md)). A request with no expiry gets one, a longer
request is shortened, and `expiry_clamped: true` marks either case. The ceiling
itself is public in `GET /api/capabilities` as `share_max_ttl_days` so a client
can offer only expiries the server will keep.

### `GET /api/files/share` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
List shares the caller owns.

**Response 200**
```json
{
  "shares": [
    { "id": 42, "path": "/storage1/report.pdf", "token": "Xy3kPq",
      "expires_at": "...", "max_downloads": 10, "downloads": 3, "created_at": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### `DELETE /api/files/share/:id` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Revokes a share.

### `GET /s/:token` ![public](https://img.shields.io/badge/-public-lightgrey)
HTML viewer page (server-rendered Vue island).

### `POST /api/share/:token/verify` ![public](https://img.shields.io/badge/-public-lightgrey)
```json
{ "pin": "1234" }
```
Returns short-lived `download_token` to be used with `/api/share/:token/download`.

### `GET /api/share/:token/download?dt=…` ![public](https://img.shields.io/badge/-public-lightgrey)
Streams the file. Increments the download counter; rejects if exceeded.

---

## Thumbnails

### `GET /api/files/thumb` ![public-signed](https://img.shields.io/badge/-public%2Fsigned-yellow)
**Query**
| Param   | Type   | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `token` | string | HMAC-signed `(file_id, size, exp)` |
| `size`  | int    | `64 \| 128 \| 256 \| 512` |

Token is generated by the backend and embedded in the file listing payload —
not user-craftable. Public so that `<img>` works without sending the session
cookie.

---

## Realtime (WebSocket)

### `POST /api/files/ws-ticket` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Mints a short-lived ticket for the socket, and returns the **absolute**
`ws_url` to open. An embedded client that cannot send a cookie uses this;
a same-origin browser can upgrade with its session instead.

### `GET /api/ws` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
The WebSocket. Subscribe to the folders on screen and receive **presence**
frames (who else is here, what they have focused) and **change** frames
(something in this folder moved).

⚠ Two things break integrations if they are not known:

- an explorer with a healthy socket **does not poll** — the 12 s re-listing is
  the fallback for a socket that failed. A reverse proxy that does not pass the
  upgrade on this path turns live updates into a folder that refreshes twice a
  minute, silently;
- the same-origin, cookie-authenticated upgrade is **origin-checked**, so the
  proxy must preserve the real `Host` header.

Frame shapes, the coalescing contract (a burst is merged into one frame per
window, carrying `count`) and the client-side debounce advice are in
[REALTIME.md](REALTIME.md).

---

## Operations (long-running)

Copy / extract / archive create kick off background ops.

### `GET /api/files/ops` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
List the caller's ops.

**Response 200**
```json
{
  "ops": [
    {
      "id": "op_AbCd", "kind": "copy", "status": "running",
      "progress": 0.42, "started_at": "...", "eta_seconds": 120
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /api/files/ops/:id` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Single op detail; same shape + final `error` if failed.

`status` is one of `queued | running | completed | failed | cancelled`.

### `POST /api/files/ops/:id/cancel` ![user](https://img.shields.io/badge/-user-blue)
Best-effort cancel. Returns `200` regardless; check `status` afterwards.

---

## Admin: storages

### `GET /api/admin/storage-drivers` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
The config contract every registered storage driver declares: its fields, their
type, which one is the storage root, which hold credentials, defaults and an
i18n key per label. Admin UIs render their storage forms from this instead of
hardcoding a field list, and the root‑path guard reads the same declaration.
**Response 200**
```json
[
  { "driver": "s3", "label": "S3 / Hetzner / MinIO", "i18n_key": "storages.driver.s3",
    "capabilities": { "read": true, "write": true, "presign": true },
    "fields": [
      { "key": "bucket", "type": "string", "required": true, "secret": false,
        "label": "Bucket", "i18n_key": "storages.fields.bucket" },
      { "key": "prefix", "type": "string", "required": true, "root": true,
        "label": "Prefix", "i18n_key": "storages.fields.prefix" }
    ] }
]
```
See [STORAGE.md → Driver descriptors](STORAGE.md#driver-descriptors-get-apiadminstorage-drivers).
`GET /api/capabilities` keeps its plain `storage_drivers: []string` name list.

> A **plugin** driver (`plugin:<name>`) appears in this list too, with the
> fields the plugin described — which is what lets an admin form render a
> driver that did not exist when the frontend was built. See
> [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md).

---

## Admin: plugins

Storage drivers that live outside the binary. Instance-wide, and in
multi-tenant mode **supertenant-only** (a tenant admin gets `403
supertenant_only`, not an empty list). With `FILEX_PLUGINS_DISABLED=1` every
route answers `503 plugins_disabled`. ⚠ The two are checked in that order: a
tenant admin is refused *before* being told whether the operator has plugins
switched on. Full picture: [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md).

### `GET /api/admin/plugins` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Every registered plugin plus its live state — the row is the admin's intent,
the state is what the manager sees right now.
**Response 200**
```json
{
  "dir": "/data/plugins",
  "requires_signature": false,
  "conformance": "enforce",
  "plugins": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "memfs", "kind": "binary", "binary": "memfs",
      "sha256": "9f2c…", "enabled": true, "version": "1.0.0",
      "driver": "memfs", "state": "running", "restarts": 0,
      "label": "In-memory (example)", "field_count": 1, "in_use": 1,
      "capabilities": { "write": true, "delete": true, "set_mtime": true,
                        "presign": false, "multipart": true },
      "conformance": {
        "verified": true, "scratch": "selftest",
        "ran_at": "2026-08-19T09:14:02Z",
        "results": [
          { "name": "write", "status": "pass", "took_ms": 1180400 },
          { "name": "presign", "status": "skip", "detail": "not declared", "took_ms": 0 }
        ]
      },
      "load": { "in_flight": 0, "waited": 0, "rejected": 0, "max_in_flight": 10 } }
  ]
}
```
`state` is one of `running` · `starting` · `failed` · `refused` · `disabled`;
`state_error` carries the reason for the last two. `in_use` counts storages on
this plugin's driver.

Top level: **`requires_signature`** says this instance refuses unsigned binaries
(trusted keys are configured), and **`conformance`** is the *mode* —
`enforce` · `warn` · `off`. Both are published so a surface can state the rules
before an install instead of after a rejection.

Per plugin: **`conformance`** is the last probe *report* — `verified`, `scratch`
(`selftest` when it ran against the plugin's own throwaway instance, `storage`
when it ran against a real storage), and one `results` entry per probe with
`status` `pass` · `fail` · `skip` and a `detail` written for the plugin's
author. **Absent means never probed** — "unverified", which is not the same as
failed. **`load`** is live: in-flight operations, callers that had to wait, and
callers that were **rejected** (anything above 0 is a user meeting an error
because the plugin is saturated).

> ⚠ Two different things are called `conformance` in one document: a **mode**
> at the top level, a **report** inside each plugin. Read the level before the
> name.

> ⚠ `took_ms` is a Go `time.Duration`, which `encoding/json` writes as
> **nanoseconds** despite the field name. Divide by 1e6 before printing
> milliseconds.

### `POST /api/admin/plugins` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Install, in one of three shapes — the Content-Type picks which:

| Shape | Body |
|---|---|
| upload | `multipart/form-data` with `name`, `file` and optionally `signature` |
| download | `{"name":"…","url":"https://…","sha256":"…","signature":"…"}` — the hash is **required** |
| remote | `{"name":"…","kind":"remote","address":"http(s)://…","token":"…"}` |

**201** with the same object as above. `409` when the name is taken, `400` for
a bad name (`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}`), a missing hash, a remote plugin
with no `FILEX_SECRET_KEY` configured to seal its token, or — when
`requires_signature` is true — a missing or unverifiable `signature` (a detached
ed25519 signature over the binary's lower-case hex sha256).

> ⚠ **201 does not mean usable.** Installing writes the row and starts the
> plugin; describe and the conformance probes happen after that, asynchronously.
> A plugin that declares a capability it cannot perform is accepted here and
> then lands in `refused` with `state_error` containing *"fails its own
> claims"*, and its driver is never registered. Poll `GET /api/admin/plugins`
> for the state rather than treating the 201 as the answer.

### `POST /api/admin/plugins/{id}/upgrade` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
`multipart/form-data` with `file` (and `signature` when required). Replaces a
**binary** plugin's file while keeping the row, the name, the driver and every
storage built on it — remove+install would take the registration with it, and a
storage whose driver has gone cannot open.

Sequence: stop → swap the file → start → describe → conformance. **200** with
the plugin's status when the new binary comes up. Otherwise **400** with
`{"error": "…the previous one was restored", "plugin": {…}}` — the old binary is
put back and started again, and the body carries the status so a page can show
what is running now instead of leaving the operator guessing. `400` too for a
remote plugin: it is upgraded where it runs.

### `PATCH /api/admin/plugins/{id}` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
`{"enabled": true|false}`. Disabling unregisters the driver, so storages on it
stop opening — they are not deleted.

### `POST /api/admin/plugins/{id}/restart` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Stop and start it. The way out of `refused` once the cause is fixed. The
conformance probes run again on every start, so a fixed plugin proves itself
without an extra step.

### `DELETE /api/admin/plugins/{id}` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
**204.** Removes the registration and, for a binary plugin, its directory.
Storages created on it are left in place.

### `GET /api/admin/storages` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
**Response 200**
```json
{
  "storages": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Local", "driver": "local", "readonly": false,
      "config_summary": "/var/lib/filex/local-storage", "last_sync": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /api/admin/storages` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
**Request** (driver-specific fields)
```json
{
  "name": "Hetzner archive",
  "driver": "s3",
  "config": {
    "bucket": "...", "region": "...", "endpoint": "...",
    "access_key": "...", "secret_key": "..."
  },
  "readonly": false,
  "sync_interval": "5m"
}
```
**Response 200** `{ "id": 7, "name": "Hetzner archive", ... }`

> ⚠ A storage on a **plugin** driver (`plugin:<name>`) is probed against this
> exact configuration *before the row is written*: filex opens the driver,

> Built-in drivers are not probed; `FILEX_PLUGIN_CONFORMANCE=off` (or `warn`)

### `PATCH /api/admin/storages/:id` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Same body shape; partial updates allowed. A plugin storage is **re-probed on
every change** — the operator may have just pointed it at a different bucket,
and a configuration that half works fails the same way a half-working plugin
does: in the user's hands, looking like filex.

### `DELETE /api/admin/storages/:id` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Removes the storage and its DB cache rows. Files in the underlying backend
are **not** deleted.

### `POST /api/admin/storages/:id/sync` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Triggers an immediate sync run. Returns `202 + { run_id: "..." }`; poll via
`/api/admin/sync-runs/:id`, or read this storage's history at
`GET /api/admin/storages/:id/sync-runs`.

### `POST /api/admin/storages/test` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Validates a connection without persisting. ⚠ The candidate configuration is in
the body — there is no `:id` in this path, because the usual caller is the
create form, which has no storage to name yet.

---

## Admin: users

### `GET /api/admin/users` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
List users. In multi-tenant mode the list is confined to the caller's tenant
(the supertenant sees all). Each row carries `used_bytes` and `quota_bytes`
(`0` = unlimited) and `enabled`, so a usage table costs one call.

### `GET /api/admin/users/{id}` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)

### `POST /api/admin/users` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
```json
{
  "email": "newuser@example.com",
  "display_name": "New User",
  "role": "user",
  "password": "...",
  "provider_id": 3
}
```
`provider_id` homes the user in a tenant. Omit it and the user lands in the
**caller's** tenant. A tenant admin may only name their own provider (`403`
otherwise); an id that matches no provider is `400`. There is no foreign key
behind the column, so it is validated here.

### `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Partial update — only the fields present in the body are touched:
`password`, `display_name`, `role`, `locale`, `timezone`, `enabled`,
`provider_id`.

`enabled: false` cuts access without deleting anything: the account cannot
log in (local, OIDC or `/dav`), existing sessions stop working, and every API
token it minted is refused. Files, quota and grants are untouched. Disabling
— like deleting or demoting — the **last admin** is refused with `409`.

`provider_id` re-homes the user into another tenant. Restricted to an
unscoped or supertenant caller (`403` otherwise).

### `GET|POST|PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}/quota` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Read or set one user's quota — see [Admin: quota](#admin-quota). `POST
/api/admin/users/{id}/quota/recompute` rebuilds `used_bytes` from node sizes.

### `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Deletes the account row. The last remaining admin cannot be deleted (`409`),
not even by itself.

**What happens to their files: nothing.** No storage object is ever removed.
The node rows survive and `nodes.owner_id` becomes `NULL`, so the files
become **unowned** — still present, still listed, still reachable by anyone
whose access does not depend on that user. Deletion is not a way to reclaim
space; move or delete the files first if that is the intent.

Precisely, on `DELETE`:

| Kept, with the user dropped (`SET NULL`) | Removed with the user (`CASCADE`) |
| --- | --- |
| `nodes.owner_id` — the files themselves | `sessions` |
| `shares.created_by` — see below | `api_tokens` |
| `file_grants.created_by` | `file_grants.user_id` — access granted **to** them |
| `audit_log.user_id` — history stays readable | `notifications`, `user_node_meta`, `node_comments` |

Share links the user created **stay live**: public resolution never looks at
`created_by`. But revoking one does, and a `NULL` creator matches nobody — so
an orphaned link can only be revoked by an admin, via
`DELETE /api/admin/shares/{id}`. Audit those before deleting a user who
shared a lot.

Their `usage_bytes` row goes with the account, so those bytes stop counting
toward any per-user total while the files remain on storage. To keep the
account's history and quota intact, prefer `enabled: false` over deletion.

---

## Admin: quota

Quota is **per user**. There is no per-provider (tenant) quota — see
[MULTI-TENANCY.md](MULTI-TENANCY.md). Every id in this section is a **user
id**; passing a provider id answers `404`.

Two spellings, same handlers:

| Nested (preferred) | Flat (original) |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/admin/users/{id}/quota` | `GET /api/admin/quota/{user_id}` |
| `POST` / `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}/quota` | `POST /api/admin/quota/{user_id}` |
| `POST /api/admin/users/{id}/quota/recompute` | `POST /api/admin/quota/{user_id}/recompute` |

### `GET …/quota` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
```json
{ "used_bytes": 1234, "quota_bytes": 5368709120, "percent_used": 0.00002, "unlimited": false }
```
A user who has never had a quota set reads back `quota_bytes: 0`,
`unlimited: true` — that is not an error. An id that names no user is `404`.

### `POST|PATCH …/quota` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
```json
{ "quota_bytes": 5368709120 }
```
`0` means unlimited; negative is `400`. Returns the fresh snapshot.

### `POST …/quota/recompute` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Rebuilds `used_bytes` from the summed size of the nodes the user owns.
Worth running after bulk imports, or after deleting a user whose files were
left behind (their bytes stop being attributed to anyone).

The caller's own snapshot is at `GET /api/files/quota/me`.

---

## Admin: external services

⚠ **Instance-wide, and in multi-tenant mode supertenant-only.** There is one document server, one converter, and one shared JWT secret behind them, so this surface decides where every tenant's documents are sent and what credential signs the handoff. A
tenant admin gets `403 supertenant_only` on **every** verb here, reads
included. Single-tenant installs are unaffected — the ordinary admin still
administers everything. See
[MULTI-TENANCY.md](MULTI-TENANCY.md#instance-wide-admin-surfaces).

### `GET /api/admin/external` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
**Response 200**
```json
{
  "entries": [
    { "Name": "onlyoffice", "Enabled": true, "URL": "https://docs.example.com",
      "SecretEnc": "***", "OptionsJSON": "{}",
      "LastCheck": "2026-09-06T08:28:32Z", "LastState": "ok",
      "env_managed": false },
    { "Name": "drawio", "Enabled": false, "URL": "", "SecretEnc": "",
      "OptionsJSON": "{}", "LastCheck": null, "LastState": "unconfigured",
      "env_managed": true }
  ]
}
```

`LastState` is one of `ok | unreachable | disabled | unconfigured | unknown`.
Secrets are never returned — a configured one reads `"***"`.

`env_managed` says the service is pinned by env/`config.yaml`. Its row is
re-asserted from there at every boot, so a `PATCH` to it applies immediately but
does not survive a restart.

### `PATCH /api/admin/external/:name` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
```json
{ "enabled": true, "url": "https://docs.example.com", "secret": "…",
  "options_json": "{}" }
```
Every field is optional; an omitted one keeps its stored value.

⚠ A `secret` of exactly `"***"` is **ignored**, because that is what `GET`
returns in place of a stored secret and a UI that re-sends what it was shown
would otherwise overwrite the real one.

**Response 200** — `{ "ok": true, "env_managed": false }`, plus a `note` when
`env_managed` is true.

The change is live: the running process reads this row on every use, so the
editor, the diagram embed and the converter pick it up on the next request. No
restart.

### `POST /api/admin/external/:name/test` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Probes the service's health endpoint — `${url}/healthcheck` for `onlyoffice`,
`${url}/healthz` for `convert`, the bare URL for `drawio` — with a 3 s timeout,
stores the verdict on the row and returns
`200 + { ok, name, reachable, url, state }`. An unknown name is `404`.

⚠ Reachable is not the same as configured: OnlyOffice also needs a JWT secret,
and a Document Server with no secret set in filex answers this probe happily
while refusing every editor session.

---

## Admin: protection & antivirus

⚠ **Instance-wide, and in multi-tenant mode supertenant-only.** Every value here is a single global row: switching antivirus off, or pointing clamd elsewhere, does it for the whole instance. The read is gated too — it returns the clamd address in force and a live reachability probe. A
tenant admin gets `403 supertenant_only` on **every** verb here, reads
included. Single-tenant installs are unaffected — the ordinary admin still
administers everything. See
[MULTI-TENANCY.md](MULTI-TENANCY.md#instance-wide-admin-surfaces).

### `GET /api/admin/protection` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Returns the trash-retention window, the version keep count, the share-link life
ceiling and the whole `antivirus` block — the switch, the mode, the clamd
address, the size ceiling, the editor save-scan window — plus a **status**
sub-object describing what this process is actually doing: what would answer
(`clamscan` / `clamdscan` / `clamd`), whether it is `reachable`, its version,
and `restart_pending`.

⚠ `restart_pending` is true for as long as the stored configuration differs
from what the running process booted with. The switch, the mode and the address
take effect **at the next restart, in both directions**; the size ceiling and
the save window apply to the next file scanned.

### `PATCH /api/admin/protection` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Partial update; echoes the fresh `GET` shape. Values are validated on save
rather than clamped later — an out-of-range number or an address like
`clamav 3310` is a `400`, and `daemon` mode with no address is refused as well.

⚠ The scanner **binary** is deliberately not settable here: it is a path this
server executes, so an admin-writable field would turn an admin account into
arbitrary command execution. It stays in `FILEX_CLAMAV_BIN`. Full semantics:
[PROTECTION.md](PROTECTION.md).

---

## Admin: webhooks

Five routes under `/api/admin/webhooks` manage **webhook v2 targets** — rows,
each with its own URL, its own signing secret and its own per-event allow-list.
`GET` masks the secret to a `secret_set` boolean and never returns the value.
One event produces one POST **per matching destination**.

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/admin/webhooks` | List targets (secrets masked) plus each one's last delivery. |
| `POST /api/admin/webhooks` | Create: `name`, `url`, optional `secret`, optional `events` allow-list, `enabled`. |
| `PATCH /api/admin/webhooks/:id` | Partial update. |
| `DELETE /api/admin/webhooks/:id` | Remove the target. |
| `POST /api/admin/webhooks/:id/test` | Send a test delivery. |

⚠ `/api/admin/notify` governs the **legacy single** webhook
(`FILEX_WEBHOOK_URL`); these govern the v2 targets. The event catalogue —
including `file.updated`, which from v0.34.0 replaces `file.uploaded` for a
write that overwrote an existing file — is in
[NOTIFICATIONS.md](NOTIFICATIONS.md).

## Admin: sync runs

### `GET /api/admin/sync-runs` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
**Query**: `?storage_id=…&limit=50&offset=0`

**Response 200**
```json
{
  "runs": [

      "id": 12, "storage_id": 1, "status": "completed",
      "started_at": "...", "finished_at": "...",
      "added": 4, "updated": 2, "removed": 1, "errors": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /api/admin/sync-runs/:id` ![admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-admin-red)
Includes per-error detail array.

## Admin: audit log

}
```
