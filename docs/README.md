# filex documentation

Self‑hosted file manager — a Go backend with a Vue 3 / React / Web Component
frontend, and pluggable **storage**, **auth**, **DB** and **queue** drivers.

New here? Start with [Installation](INSTALLATION.md), then add a storage
([Storage](STORAGE.md)) and, if you want, sign‑in via [SSO](SSO.md).

## Getting started

- [Installation](INSTALLATION.md) — minimal → full Compose → Helm → binary
- [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) — every `FILEX_*` variable + `config.yaml`
- [Releases](RELEASES.md) — every release with a plain‑English summary
  (generated from the GitHub releases when a release is cut, by
  `npm run releases`)
- [Updates](UPDATES.md) — how filex checks for, and installs, a new release

## Storage

- [Storage](STORAGE.md) — how mounts work, adding one, and the adapters:
  local · S3 / S3‑compatible · SFTP · WebDAV · FTP · SMB/CIFS
- [Moving files between storages](STORAGE.md#moving-files-between-storages) — what
  copy, cut and drag mean when the two ends are different storages
- [NAS over NFS / SMB](STORAGE.md#nas-nfs-smb-and-friends) — mount it with the
  OS, serve it with `local`, and the three traps that come with it
- [Slow storage](STORAGE.md#slow-storage) — what is already cached, and what is
  actually worth tuning
- [Storage plugins](PLUGINS.md) — teaching filex a backend it does not ship:
  installing one, upgrading it in place, and writing one (the protocol, the Go
  SDK, presigned URLs and multipart) — plus **conformance**, the probes that
  refuse a plugin which cannot do what it claims

## Reaching filex without a browser

- [Protocols](PROTOCOLS.md) — the map: which protocols filex connects *to*, which
  it can be *reached as*, and the credential each one takes
- [WebDAV](WEBDAV.md) — mapping a drive from Windows / macOS / Linux
- [`filex mount`](PROTOCOLS.md#filex-mount) — a remote server over ordinary
  HTTPS: a folder on Linux, a drive letter on Windows; ⚠ not a sync, and not
  available on macOS
- [CLI client](CLI.md) — `filex client` and `filex sync` against a remote server

## Authentication & access

- [SSO (OIDC)](SSO.md) — sign in with Keycloak / Auth0 / Authentik / Okta / …
- [LDAP & reverse‑proxy auth](LDAP.md) — Active Directory / LDAP, header auth
- [RBAC & permissions](RBAC.md) — account roles, per‑storage RBAC, per‑item grants

## Integrations

- [OnlyOffice](ONLYOFFICE.md) — in‑browser editing of Office documents
- [Converter](CONVERT-INTEGRATION.md) — universal file conversion

## Features

- [Desktop app](DESKTOP.md) — Windows/Linux/macOS app: multiple accounts, background sync,
  [dragging files out onto the desktop](DESKTOP.md#dragging-files-out),
  [opening Office documents off your own disk](DESKTOP.md#opening-documents-from-your-computer),
  [a portable Windows copy that installs nothing](DESKTOP.md#portable-windows)
- [Folder sync](SYNC.md) — how a folder on your PC is kept in step with the server
- [Uploads](UPLOADS.md) — the staged, resumable upload path: chunked, works on
  every driver, survives a dropped connection
- [Sharing & file requests](SHARING.md) — public download links + upload/file‑drop;
  the maximum link life, and how the folder-ZIP cache is bounded
- [Thumbnails](thumbnails.md) — image / video / pdf / office previews
- [Search](SEARCH.md) — embedded full‑text index: forgiving filename
  matching (separators, several words in any order, folders, typos), VS
  Code-style subsequence scoring, ranked results, `tag:` filters, and an index
  that rebuilds itself after an upgrade without going dark
- [AI assistant](ASSISTANT.md) — the chat panel in the end-user app: what it may
  look at, why reading a file needs permission for that one file, and the part
  worth reading even if you never enable it — the model holds no tool that
  changes anything, it writes a plan, and the **server** executes the stored
  plan without consulting the model again
- [Realtime updates & presence](REALTIME.md) — the WebSocket an open explorer
  runs on: the ticket, the change and presence frames, how a burst is
  coalesced (and why a plain trailing debounce starves), and the 12 s polling
  fallback
- [Notifications](NOTIFICATIONS.md) — webhook + in‑app bell
- [Trash & versioning](TRASH-VERSIONING.md) — soft‑delete/restore + file history
- [Replication](REPLICATION.md) — primary→replica mirroring & reconcile
- [Quotas](QUOTAS.md) — per‑user ceilings: what counts, when it is
  released, and how a public drop link is billed
- [Protection & antivirus](PROTECTION.md) — ClamAV scanning, through a local
  binary or a clamd daemon over TCP or a unix socket, plus the trash and version
  retention windows and the share-link life ceiling, behind one admin screen
- [End‑to‑end encryption](E2E-ENCRYPTION.md) — client‑side WebCrypto folders;
  the server stores ciphertext and never receives a key. Recovery keys, optional
  operator key escrow, and exactly what each one can and cannot open
- [Multi‑tenancy](MULTI-TENANCY.md) — provider/tenant mode, per‑tenant isolation
  on one instance
- [ShareX](SHAREX.md) — the screenshot‑upload endpoint and its custom uploader

## Deployment

- [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md) — reverse proxy, HTTPS, scaling, backup
- [Docker](DOCKER.md) — images & compose details
- [Metrics](METRICS.md) — the Prometheus surface, how to scrape it, and
  the handful of alerts worth having
- Packaging in the repo: [`deploy/compose/`](../deploy/compose/) (minimal + full)
  and [`deploy/helm/filex/`](../deploy/helm/filex/) (Kubernetes)

## Develop & integrate

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) — how the pieces fit
- [Backend](BACKEND.md) — internals
- [HTTP / component API](API.md)
- [Embedding the explorer](INTEGRATION.md) — Vue / React / Web Component, and the
  two options every wrapper shares: the **navigation panel** (`sideNav`) and the
  chrome **profiles** (`uiProfile`: `standard` · `simple` · `drive`)
- [AI & MCP](MCP.md) — API tokens (including the `user` / `app` token kinds), scopes, the MCP endpoint for agents, and credential-free upload tickets for large local files

## Repo only — not published to docs.filex.sh

These live in the repo and are deliberately kept off the published site
(`srcExclude` in `docs-site/.vitepress/config.mts`) — ⚠ a page VitePress builds
is reachable by URL and indexable whether or not anything links to it, so
"leave it out of the sidebar" is not the same as "do not publish it".

⚠ Linked by full URL rather than relatively: a relative link to a page the site
does not build is a **dead link that fails the docs build**, which is how this
list was written the first time.

- [Cloud preparation](https://github.com/BRF-Tech/filex/blob/main/docs/CLOUD.md)
  — scaffolding for a hosted offering that has **not** launched; publishing it
  would announce a service that does not exist
- **This page.** `docs/README.md` is the index GitHub renders when you open
  `docs/`, and it stays in the repository — but the site already has a home
  page and a sidebar, so publishing it put a second, competing table of
  contents at `/README`, one whose last section explains which pages are kept
  off the site. That is a note for contributors, not for readers

⚠ Three more are excluded from the site **and** from this repository, so they
are deliberately listed without links — a deployment runbook carrying one
installation's real host names and paths, and two migration guides written for
downstream applications that were never public (`MIGRATION.md`, off the in-tree
`@brftech/file-explorer`, and `MIGRATION_FISHAPP.md`). They would be dead links
here, which is exactly the failure the note above describes.

> `MIGRATION.md` was the third case and did not look like one: it was stripped
> from the public repository like the other two, but nothing removed the links
> to it, and it was not in `srcExclude` — so the published site carried it
> while the published README pointed at a file that is not there.

Handover notes under `docs/handovers/` are excluded by glob for the same
reason: they are working notes between maintainers, and the next one must be
excluded by default rather than by somebody remembering to add it.
