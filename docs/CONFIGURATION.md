# Configuration

filex reads configuration in this order (highest precedence first):

1. **Environment variables** (`FILEX_*`)
2. **`config.yaml`** (path via `--config`, `FILEX_CONFIG`, or `~/.filex/config.yaml` if present)
3. **Built-in defaults**

For containers, environment variables are easiest. For rich setups (LDAP,
proxy‑header auth, custom CORS) a `config.yaml` is handier because a few settings
are **file‑only** (noted below). Individual storages are **not** configured here
— they're database records; see [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md).

## Install-time settings (`FILEX_INSTALLATION_*`)

Settings with the **`FILEX_INSTALLATION_`** prefix are decided at the first
boot of an installation and **cannot be edited afterwards**. filex records what
it was given in the `settings` table (key `installation.pinned`) and mirrors it
to `<data-dir>/installation.json`; on every later boot it compares the two and
**refuses to start** if they disagree, printing what changed and what your
options are.

That is not caution for its own sake. These settings change the *shape of data
already written*, so flipping one later does not reconfigure anything — it
produces an installation whose guarantees are true for some of its data and
false for the rest, with nothing on either half to say which. Refusing to start
is the only honest response.

There is exactly one supervised exception, [adoption](#adopting-escrow-later),
and it exists because the alternative was worse: escrow could only ever be
chosen in the first second of an installation's life, and nobody decides
key-escrow policy before they have a single file.

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_INSTALLATION_E2E_ESCROW_KEY` | *(unset — escrow off)* | Base64 SPKI **public** key (RSA ≥ 2048, PEM armour and whitespace tolerated) enabling [E2E key escrow](E2E-ENCRYPTION.md#key-escrow-optional-operator-recovery). Generate the pair with `filex e2e-escrow keygen`; put the public half here and keep the private half yourself. |
| `FILEX_INSTALLATION_E2E_ESCROW_ADOPT` | `false` | One-time consent to turn escrow **on** for an installation that already exists. Read only when the pinned record has no escrow key and the environment supplies one; ignored on a first boot, and it does **not** authorise changing or removing a key. See [Adopting escrow later](#adopting-escrow-later). |

**Why escrow cannot simply be edited.** An encrypted folder wraps its master
key once per recovery path *when the folder is created*. A folder made while
escrow was off carries no escrow-wrapped key, and nothing can add one without
the folder password — which the server never has. So:

- turning escrow **on** later gives you access to nothing that already exists
  (this is the one you can still choose to do — see below — as long as you
  understand that sentence);
- **changing** the key leaves old folders openable only by the old private key
  and new ones only by the new;
- turning it **off** does not un-escrow anything already created.

**If you did not mean to change it**, the supported paths are: restore the
original value, or start a new installation with a fresh data directory —
keeping the old escrow private key for as long as the folders created under it
exist.

### Adopting escrow later

Turning escrow on for a running installation is allowed, once, and only when
you say so in a second variable:

```bash
FILEX_INSTALLATION_E2E_ESCROW_KEY=MIIBoj...      # the public half
FILEX_INSTALLATION_E2E_ESCROW_ADOPT=1            # "yes, I mean it"
```

Start the server. It logs the adoption at **WARN**, writes it to the record,
and from that moment new encrypted folders carry an escrow slot. You can drop
`_ADOPT` again on the next deploy; it is read only while the pinned record has
no escrow key, so leaving it set does nothing.

⚠⚠ **Adoption is not retroactive, and no future version can make it so — for
you.** Every encrypted folder that existed before the adoption has no
escrow-wrapped key, and nothing you do as operator gives it one: adding a slot
needs the folder password, which the server has never had. Your escrow private
key opens folders created *after* the adoption, and nothing else.

⚠ Each folder's **owner** can grant a slot, from their browser, with the folder
password. filex offers it to them the next time they unlock, states in plain
words that it hands you a permanent second way in, and records a refusal so
they are not asked again — see
[offering an existing folder a slot](E2E-ENCRYPTION.md#offering-an-existing-folder-an-escrow-slot).
You can ask; you cannot take. In the explorer, the unlock dialog says all of
this on the older folders rather than showing an escrow tab that cannot work.

Why a separate variable rather than "the key appeared, so they must have meant
it": an escrow key arrives by being pasted into a compose file, a Helm values
file or a `.env`, usually copied from another deployment. That is the shape of
an accident, and the accident is silent — the installation gains a second key
holder, only new folders get it, and nothing looks wrong until somebody needs
the key on an old folder. One extra line, in the file you are already editing,
is the smallest thing that is still a decision.

After an adoption the record separates the two dates, because "when was this
installed?" and "when did it gain a second key?" are different questions:

```json
{
  "e2e_escrow_kid": "9f2c1a55b4e07d38",
  "e2e_escrow_alg": "RSA-OAEP-256",
  "pinned_at": "2026-09-05T12:02:24Z",
  "pinned_by": "first-boot",
  "e2e_escrow_adopted_at": "2026-11-20T08:30:00Z",
  "e2e_escrow_adopted_by": "env:FILEX_INSTALLATION_E2E_ESCROW_ADOPT",
  "e2e_escrow_adoption_note": "escrow was turned on after this installation already existed; folders created BEFORE e2e_escrow_adopted_at have no escrow-wrapped key, so the escrow key does not open them and no operator action can change that. Each folder's OWNER can grant it from the browser with the folder password"
}
```

`e2e_escrow_adopted_at` is the boundary of **automatic** coverage: folders
older than it get no escrow slot at creation, and no operator action gives them
one. It is not a claim about every folder forever — one whose owner
[granted a slot](E2E-ENCRYPTION.md#offering-an-existing-folder-an-escrow-slot)
is simply no longer described by it, and the marker's `esc` slot is the only
authority on which key opens which folder. A record without these fields means
escrow was present from the first boot (or is off).

⚠ `_ADOPT` is **not** a general override. Pointing the key at a different value,
or removing it, is still a start-time failure with the flag set — those two
really do leave folders behind that the running configuration can no longer
describe.

⚠ An unparseable value is **fatal**, not ignored. Running without escrow while
the operator believes they configured it is the one failure mode worth crashing
over.

⚠ The private half never reaches filex. `filex e2e-escrow keygen` writes
nothing and touches no database; it prints the pair and exits. That is what
makes a stolen filex database worthless to an attacker even with escrow on —
and what makes losing the private key unrecoverable.

## Server & networking

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_LISTEN` | `0.0.0.0:5212` | Bind address. |
| `FILEX_PUBLIC_URL` | `http://localhost:5212` | **The external URL users open.** Baked into share links, the OIDC redirect and OnlyOffice fetch/callback — set it to your real `https://…` domain behind a proxy. |
| `FILEX_DATA_DIR` | `~/.filex` (`/data` in Docker) | Holds the SQLite DB, search index, thumbnail cache, first‑run secret. |
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_LOCALE` | — | Pin the initial UI language (`en` / `tr`) for users who haven't chosen one, overriding browser detection. A user's explicit language switch still wins. |
| `FILEX_MULTI_TENANT` | `false` | Turn on native multi-tenancy — one install serves N tenants, each a host-bound auth realm (provider) confined to its own storage(s). **Off = a normal single-tenant install, behaviour unchanged.** See [MULTI-TENANCY.md](./MULTI-TENANCY.md). |
| `FILEX_COOKIE_DOMAIN` | — (host-only) | `Domain` attribute for the `filex_session` cookie, e.g. `.example.com` — subdomains of that domain then share the session. Applied on **both** set and clear, so logout removes the same cookie it created. Empty = host-only cookie (unchanged behaviour). `Secure`/`SameSite`/`HttpOnly` are unaffected. **Multi-tenant:** this is only the last-resort fallback — the cookie Domain resolves per tenant: the provider's `cookie_domain` field wins, else it is derived from the provider host by dropping its first label (`files.example.com` → `.example.com`), else this global value. ⚠ A tenant served on its bare apex, or whose derivation would land on a public suffix (`tenant.com.tr` → `.com.tr`, which browsers reject), must set `cookie_domain` explicitly. See [MULTI-TENANCY.md](./MULTI-TENANCY.md). |
| `FILEX_CONFIG` | — | Path to `config.yaml` (same as `--config`). |

---

## Logging

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug` · `info` · `warn` · `error` |
| `FILEX_LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | `text` · `json` |

---

## Database

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_DB_DRIVER` | `sqlite` | `sqlite` · `postgres` · `mysql` |
| `FILEX_DB_DSN` | — | Connection string. Empty + sqlite → `<data_dir>/instance.sqlite`. |

DSN examples:
- postgres: `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require`
- mysql: `user:pass@tcp(host:3306)/dbname?parseTime=true&loc=UTC&charset=utf8mb4`

Migrations **run automatically on startup**; also `filex migrate up|down|status`.
SQLite (pure Go, CGO‑free) is a fine default; **PostgreSQL is recommended for
teams/HA**. MySQL is supported for read‑mostly use (a few upsert paths are
SQLite/Postgres‑only). See [database drivers](#database) note above.

---

## Authentication

Pick drivers with `FILEX_AUTH_DRIVERS` (comma list, tried in order, first match
wins). The **API‑token driver is always on** regardless.

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_AUTH_DRIVERS` | `local` | e.g. `local,oidc`, `local,ldap`, `proxy_header` |

**OIDC / SSO** (see [SSO.md](SSO.md)):

| Env var (legacy `FILEX_AUTH_OIDC_*` also accepted) | Description |
|---|---|
| `FILEX_OIDC_ISSUER` | IdP issuer URL |
| `FILEX_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | Client ID |
| `FILEX_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret |
| `FILEX_OIDC_REDIRECT_URL` | `<public>/api/auth/oidc/callback` |
| `FILEX_OIDC_ROLE_CLAIM` | Claim carrying roles/groups |
| `FILEX_OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP` | Value that elevates to admin |
| `FILEX_OIDC_AUTO_REDIRECT` | **SSO-first login** (default `false`): the login page starts the OIDC flow immediately instead of showing the password form. Local login stays available behind a "Sign in with password" link (`/admin/login?local=1`) for break-glass/`admin@local`. The redirect is skipped on `?local=1`, after a failed IdP round-trip (`?error=oidc`) and on `?maintenance=1`, so a broken IdP can never cause a redirect loop. Requires `oidc` in `FILEX_AUTH_DRIVERS`. Multi-tenant: the flag is instance-global; the flow itself already dispatches per request host to the right tenant realm. |

**LDAP** (enable with `FILEX_AUTH_DRIVERS=local,ldap`):

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `FILEX_LDAP_URL` | Directory URL, e.g. `ldaps://ldap.example.com` |
| `FILEX_LDAP_BIND_DN` | Service bind DN |
| `FILEX_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD` | Service bind password |
| `FILEX_LDAP_BASE_DN` | Search base for users |
| `FILEX_LDAP_USER_FILTER` | User filter, e.g. `(mail=%s)` |
| `FILEX_LDAP_EMAIL_ATTR` | Attribute holding the email (e.g. `mail`) |
| `FILEX_LDAP_START_TLS` | `true` to upgrade a plain connection with StartTLS |
| `FILEX_LDAP_CA_FILE` | PEM bundle holding the CA that signed the directory certificate. Appended to the system trust store, not substituted for it. Needed for an internal/private CA on `ldaps://` **or** StartTLS. |
| `FILEX_LDAP_PROTOCOL_LOGIN` | `false` to stop directory accounts from signing in over WebDAV/SFTP/FTPS/S3/NFS with their directory password. Default `true`. |

> `FILEX_LDAP_USER_FILTER` may contain the placeholder more than once — every
> `%s` is filled with the same escaped identifier, so the usual AD filter that
> accepts either address form works as written:
> `(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(|(mail=%s)(userPrincipalName=%s)))`

**Proxy‑header** — trust an authenticating reverse proxy (enable with
`FILEX_AUTH_DRIVERS=proxy_header`):

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `FILEX_HEADER_EMAIL` | Header carrying the authenticated email (e.g. `X-Auth-Email`) |
| `FILEX_HEADER_GROUP` | Header carrying roles/groups (e.g. `X-Auth-Roles`) |
| `FILEX_HEADER_TRUSTED_IPS` | Comma list of proxy CIDRs allowed to set the headers |
| `FILEX_HEADER_ADMIN_GROUP` | Group value that elevates a user to admin |

> LDAP and proxy‑header can still be set under `auth.ldap.*` /
> `auth.header_proxy.*` in [config.yaml](#configyaml); the env vars above override
> those. See [SSO.md → other auth drivers](SSO.md#other-auth-drivers).

Local auth uses the `filex_session` cookie (12 h), bcrypt passwords, optional
TOTP 2FA. First boot creates `admin@local` (or seed a known admin — see
[Zero‑touch seeding](#zero-touch-seeding) and [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md#first-run)).

---

## Zero-touch seeding

These variables **seed the database once, on first boot, only when the target
record is absent.** They let a fresh `docker compose up` / `helm install` come up
fully configured from env alone — no admin‑UI clicks. Once a record exists, later
operator edits in the UI **always win**; changing the env afterwards does **not**
re‑seed or overwrite. (OIDC/LDAP/header auth are read live from env every boot and
so are configured in [Authentication](#authentication), not here.)

**First admin** — created if the user table is empty:

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@local` | Email of the seeded admin account. |
| `FILEX_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(random, printed once)* | Password for that admin. Omit both to get a random `admin@local` (see [INSTALLATION.md → first run](INSTALLATION.md#first-run)). |

**SMTP** (mailer) — seeded when host, port and from are all set:

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `FILEX_SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server host. |
| `FILEX_SMTP_PORT` | SMTP server port. |
| `FILEX_SMTP_USERNAME` | Auth username (optional). |
| `FILEX_SMTP_PASSWORD` | Auth password (optional). |
| `FILEX_SMTP_FROM` | From address on outbound mail. |
| `FILEX_SMTP_TLS` | `starttls` · `tls` · `none`. |

**Branding & trash:**

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `FILEX_SITE_NAME` | Instance display name shown in the UI. |
| `FILEX_TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS` | Days to keep trashed items before purge (see [TRASH-VERSIONING.md](TRASH-VERSIONING.md)). |
| `FILEX_SHARE_MAX_TTL` | Longest life a **new** share link may be given — `7`, `7d` or `168h`; `0` = no ceiling. Seeds `share.max_ttl_days` (default 7) once; afterwards the admin **Protection** page owns it. Existing links are never changed (see [SHARING.md](SHARING.md)). |

**Default storage** — seeds one initial storage when **no storage exists yet**, so
a fresh install already has a working place for files. Leave
`FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_DRIVER` empty to seed nothing. (See [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md)
for the storage model.)

| Env var | Applies to | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_DRIVER` | both | `local` · `s3` (empty = seed no storage). |
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_NAME` | both | Display name / top‑level folder label. |
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_MOUNT` | both | Logical mount point (default `/`). |
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_PATH` | local | On‑disk directory to serve. |
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET` | s3 | Bucket name. |
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_S3_PREFIX` | s3 | Key prefix = storage root (keep non‑empty — root guard). |
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT` | s3 | Custom endpoint (MinIO/R2/Hetzner …); omit for AWS. |
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_S3_REGION` | s3 | e.g. `us-east-1`; `auto` for R2/MinIO. |
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY` | s3 | Access key. |
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_KEY` | s3 | Secret key. |
| `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_S3_PATH_STYLE` | s3 | `true` for path‑style addressing (MinIO/Hetzner/B2/R2). |

---

## External services

Each is optional — an empty URL disables it. Set via env, `external_services.*`,
**or the admin UI** (*Settings → External services*).

The value the running process uses is always the one in the `external_services`
table, read on every request, so a change made in the admin UI takes effect
without a restart. Env and `config.yaml` are declarative configuration **for**
that table: a service they name is re-asserted onto its row at every boot, so
editing `FILEX_ONLYOFFICE_URL` and restarting still works — and an admin-UI edit
to such a service applies now but is reverted at the next start.
`GET /api/admin/external` returns `env_managed: true` for those, and the UI
labels them.

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `FILEX_ONLYOFFICE_URL` | OnlyOffice Document Server URL (see [ONLYOFFICE.md](ONLYOFFICE.md)) |
| `FILEX_ONLYOFFICE_JWT` | Shared JWT secret — must match the Document Server |
| `FILEX_DRAWIO_URL` | Drawio embed URL (diagram editing) |
| `FILEX_CONVERT_URL` | External universal converter URL |

> **Mermaid needs no service.** Mermaid diagrams render entirely client‑side in
> the browser via a bundled `mermaid` library — there is nothing to deploy and no
> URL to set (the former `FILEX_MERMAID_URL` was removed).

---

## Protocol endpoints (S3 · SFTP · FTPS · NFS · WebDAV)

filex can be reached as five protocols besides HTTP. Full picture, including
which credential each one takes and the traps that cost real time:
[PROTOCOLS.md](./PROTOCOLS.md).

⚠ **S3 and `/dav` are ON by default; the other three are OFF.** The two that are
on do not open a port of their own and refuse every unsigned or unauthenticated
request, and a credential still has to be minted before anything can reach them.
The three that open a **listener** stay off until asked for — a port nobody
requested is not something to open for them.

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_SECRET_KEY` | — | ⚠⚠ **Required once anybody mints an S3 access key.** SigV4 verifies a request by recomputing an HMAC chain from the secret, so unlike a token it cannot be hashed — filex seals it with AES-GCM under this key. With no key configured, minting an access key **fails** rather than storing plaintext. **Changing or losing it stops every existing access key from verifying**, so treat it like the database, not like a password: back it up, do not rotate it casually. Any 32+ random bytes. |
| `FILEX_S3` | `1` | The S3-compatible endpoint. Set `0` to switch it off. |
| `FILEX_S3_DOMAIN` | — | Dedicated host for the endpoint, e.g. `s3.example.com`, which also enables virtual-hosted addressing (`bucket.s3.example.com`). Empty leaves the endpoint under `/s3`, path-style only. ⚠⚠ **Never point this at the host the app itself serves** — the whole site then answers as S3. ⚠ Setting it needs a wildcard A record **and** a wildcard certificate for `*.<domain>`; without both, current SDKs (which default to virtual-hosted) fail at TLS with nothing that names the cause. |
| `FILEX_SFTP` | `0` | The SFTP endpoint. Its own TCP listener, not a route. |
| `FILEX_SFTP_ADDR` | `:2022` | Listen address. 2022 by convention — sftpgo and `rclone serve sftp` use it, while 2222 reads as "SSH in a container". |
| `FILEX_SFTP_HOST_KEY_DIR` | `<data>/ssh` | Where the server's host keys live. ⚠ **It must survive a rebuild**: regenerating host keys gives every user the "REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED" warning, which is indistinguishable from an attack. |
| `FILEX_SFTP_BANNER` | — | Text shown before authentication. |
| `FILEX_FTPS` | `0` | The FTPS endpoint. ⚠ Explicit TLS is **mandatory** on both channels and there is no switch to relax it: plain FTP sends the password in the clear and the file after it. |
| `FILEX_FTPS_ADDR` | `:2121` | Control channel. Port 21 needs root. |
| `FILEX_FTPS_PASV_MIN` / `_MAX` | `30000` / `30100` | The passive data-port range. ⚠⚠ **Open it on the firewall too** — a blocked range makes every transfer *hang* with no error on either side, which is the classic FTP failure and impossible to guess at from the client end. |
| `FILEX_FTPS_PUBLIC_HOST` | — | The address to advertise for passive connections, when it differs from what the server sees (NAT, Docker). A host name or an IPv4 address; a name is resolved at startup, because the PASV reply itself can only carry a dotted quad. ⚠ IPv6 has no PASV representation at all — a v6-only deployment must rely on EPSV, which needs no address and so needs no setting. |
| `FILEX_FTPS_CERT` / `_KEY` | — | TLS certificate. Absent, filex generates a self-signed one and the guide says so, so nobody has to discover it from a client warning. **Re-read when the files change** (mtime/size checked on every handshake), so a real, auto-renewing certificate — Caddy's, certbot's — can be mounted read-only and is picked up by the next connection with no restart. A renewal that lands half-written keeps the previous certificate serving and logs a warning. |
| `FILEX_FTPS_BANNER` | — | Greeting line shown on connect. |
| `FILEX_NFS` | `0` | The NFSv3 endpoint. ⚠⚠ **NFSv3 is unencrypted** — anyone who can read the traffic sees the files, and anyone who learns an export path can mount it. LAN or VPN only; for anything off-LAN the answer is `filex mount`. |
| `FILEX_NFS_ADDR` | `:2049` | Listen address. ⚠ There is no portmapper on 111, so clients must be given `port=` and `mountport=` explicitly — and Windows' "Client for NFS" cannot say that at all, so it only works on the standard 2049. |
| `FILEX_DAV` | `1` | The WebDAV endpoint at `/dav`. |

---

## Storage plugins

Drivers that live outside the binary — see [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md).

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_PLUGINS_DISABLED` | `0`, **`1` in demo mode** | Turns the whole subsystem off: nothing under `<data-dir>/plugins` is launched, no remote plugin is contacted, and the admin API answers 503 saying so. On by default, because a plugin is only ever installed by an admin — but an operator hardening a shared instance may not want the admin role to include “run a program on the server”. | ⚠⚠ **`FILEX_DEMO_MODE` flips this default to off.** A demo publishes an admin login — that is what a demo is — and this API is admin-only, so on a demo "admin-only" means anybody; installing a plugin runs an uploaded program on the host. Set `FILEX_PLUGINS_DISABLED=0` to override that deliberately.
| `FILEX_PLUGIN_CONFORMANCE` | `enforce` | `enforce` · `warn` · `off`. filex **probes every capability a plugin declares** — at install against the plugin's own throwaway area, and again when a storage on it is saved, against that real configuration. `enforce` refuses a plugin that fails its own claims and refuses to save a storage on it. `warn` registers it anyway and keeps the report — for somebody *writing* a plugin, never for a shared instance: the cost of a broken claim is paid by the user, who meets an operation the UI offered and reads the failure as filex being broken. `off` skips both gates. Anything unrecognised falls back to `enforce`. |
| `FILEX_PLUGIN_TRUSTED_KEYS` | — | Comma-separated ed25519 **public** keys (hex or standard base64) allowed to sign a plugin. Set any key and an unsigned or badly signed binary is refused at install *and* at upgrade, and the admin API reports `requires_signature: true` so the UI asks for the signature up front. Left empty, no signature is asked for and the recorded sha256 is all an install carries. See [PLUGINS.md → Signed plugins](PLUGINS.md#signed-plugins). |
| `FILEX_PLUGIN_MAX_INFLIGHT` | `10` | Concurrent operations allowed **per plugin**. A caller that waits 5 s for a slot is refused rather than queued, and counted as `outcome="busy"` in [the metrics](METRICS.md#storage-plugins) — a sizing signal, not a bug. Raise it for a fast local plugin, lower it to keep a slow remote one from occupying the server. `0` or nonsense keeps the default. |
| `FILEX_SECRET_KEY` | — | Also seals a **remote** plugin's bearer token. Without it, registering a remote plugin is refused rather than stored in plaintext (binary plugins get a token minted per start, which is never stored). |

Installed binaries live in `<data-dir>/plugins/<name>/`, and a plugin's socket
in `<data-dir>/plugins/<name>/run/` (mode 0600). In multi-tenant mode the admin
surface is supertenant-only.

What is **not** configurable from the environment, and is cheaper to read here
than to search for:

- **The waiting and deadline figures around the ceiling**: 5 seconds waiting for
  a slot, 60 seconds on metadata calls. Streaming reads and writes are
  deliberately exempt — a 20 GB upload is legitimately slow, and a deadline
  there turns a working transfer into a failed one.
- **The plugin log rate limit** (50 lines/s, burst 200). Dropped lines are
  reported once per window rather than silently lost.

> ⚠ Signature enforcement is **off until you set `FILEX_PLUGIN_TRUSTED_KEYS`**.
> Until then a plugin is accepted on the strength of its sha256, which proves
> only that the file has not changed since it arrived — never who it came from.

---

## Storage sync

> ⚠ **A single failed sync run is not an error.** A run that cannot list the
> backend (a 503/504 from an object store under load, say) is logged at INFO and
> the catalogue is refreshed on the next tick. Only **three consecutive**
> failures are reported as a warning — that is a storage genuinely not
> answering, not a hiccup. The message carries the streak, and recovery is
> logged too.

Fallback cadence for the [sync worker](STORAGE.md#sync), used by storages that
do not set their own `sync_interval_s`. A storage that does set one wins.

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_SYNC_INTERVAL` | `15m` | Go duration (`30s`, `15m`, `1h`). Values under 5 s are treated as "unset". |

> ⚠ The variable is `FILEX_SYNC_INTERVAL`, **not** `FILEX_SYNC_DEFAULT_INTERVAL`.
> An unparseable value logs a warning at boot and keeps the default rather than
> failing silently.

> ⚠ **`FILEX_SYNC_WORKERS` was removed in v0.20.** It was documented here as

## Uploads (staged / resumable)

Large uploads land in filex's own staging area first and are transferred to the
storage backend by a background job, so they survive a dropped connection and
work on every driver. See [UPLOADS.md](UPLOADS.md).

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_UPLOAD_STAGING_DIR` | `<data_dir>/uploads` | Where in‑flight upload parts live. |
| `FILEX_UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE` | `8388608` (8 MiB) | Default part size when the client does not request one. |
| `FILEX_UPLOAD_STAGING_TTL` | `24h` | Idle time before the sweeper removes an abandoned staging directory. Staging that belongs to a file you delete **permanently** is released at once and does not wait for this. |

> ⚠ The whole object passes through the staging directory — put it on a
> filesystem with room for the largest upload you expect. `begin` refuses when
> less than `size × 1.2` is free.

---

## Antivirus (ClamAV)

Optional. filex scans written files with ClamAV, reached either through a local
**binary** or through a **clamd daemon** over TCP or a unix socket; see
[PROTECTION.md](PROTECTION.md#antivirus-clamav) for how to choose between them
and for what a clean, infected or failed scan does.

⚠⚠ **Every setting below now lives in the database**, edited on
**Settings → Protection** in the admin UI. The environment variables still
exist, but only as a **seed**:

> **The env var applies on a boot where the setting has no stored row yet, and
> never again.** Once a row exists — written by that first-boot seeding, or by
> an admin on the Protection page — the variable is inert. Editing it in your
> compose file and restarting the container changes nothing, and no warning is
> printed, because there is nothing unusual about a setting that already has a
> value. Change them on the Protection page.

The seed is applied per setting, not per family: a setting whose row does not
exist yet is seeded from its variable even if its siblings already have rows.
So a deployment upgrading from an older filex keeps exactly the values it had.

| Env var | Where it lives now | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_CLAMAV` | **seed → database** (`antivirus.enabled`) | on | The on/off switch. `0`/`false` disables scanning. ⚠⚠ It used to be an env-only kill switch and is now a **seed**: an install that had `FILEX_CLAMAV=0` keeps scanning off across the upgrade, because the value is seeded into the row on the first boot — but from then on the switch is on the Protection page and editing the variable does nothing. ⚠ Takes effect at the **next restart**, in both directions (see below). |
| `FILEX_CLAMAV_MODE` | **seed → database** (`antivirus.mode`) | `binary` | How ClamAV is reached: `binary` (run `clamdscan`/`clamscan` from filex's own `$PATH`) or `daemon` (talk to a running clamd). ⚠ Setting `FILEX_CLAMAV_ADDR` without this seeds `daemon`, because a compose file that names a clamd container and comes up in binary mode is a deployment that looks configured and scans nothing. ⚠ Next restart. |
| `FILEX_CLAMAV_ADDR` | **seed → database** (`antivirus.clamd_addr`) | unset | The clamd address for `daemon` mode: `clamav:3310`, `tcp://127.0.0.1:3310`, a bare host (port 3310 is assumed), or a unix socket path such as `/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl`. The bytes are streamed to the daemon, so **filex and clamd need no shared filesystem** — which is what makes ClamAV-in-its-own-container work. An unparseable address is refused when you save it, not discovered at scan time. ⚠ Next restart. |
| `FILEX_CLAMAV_BIN` | environment | unset | Absolute path to `clamdscan`/`clamscan` for `binary` mode; authoritative when set, and an invalid path disables scanning rather than silently falling back to `$PATH`. ⚠ The one that stays an environment concern **deliberately**: this is a path the server *executes*, so an admin-writable field for it would turn an admin account into arbitrary command execution as the filex process. A clamd *address* is a dial target, never executed, which is why that one is editable. |
| `FILEX_CLAMAV_MAX` | **seed → database** (`antivirus.max_scan_mb`) | 100 MB | Largest file that gets scanned; bigger files are skipped, not failed. ⚠ The variable is in **bytes**, the stored setting is in **megabytes** — the number an admin types. The conversion at seed time rounds **up**, so an upgrade never shrinks an existing ceiling. Range 1–10240 MB. |
| `FILEX_CLAMAV_SAVE_WINDOW_MINUTES` | **seed → database** (`antivirus.save_scan_window_minutes`) | 30 | How long a save from the built-in text editor waits before its scan is queued; further saves to the same file inside that window join it instead of queueing more. Range 2–60 minutes; `0` is refused. See below. |

### ⚠⚠ Three of them take effect at the next restart

The switch, the mode and the clamd address are stored the moment you save them
and are **in force only after filex restarts — in both directions.** Turning
scanning on does not start it and turning it off does not stop it until then,
because the scan pipeline is wired once at boot: the queue handler is
registered and the write paths are handed an enqueue function only when
scanning resolved as available.

This is a deliberate choice, not an oversight. Making "off" immediate while
"on" stayed deferred — the shape a naive implementation falls into, since
suppressing work is easy and creating a worker-pool handler at runtime is not —
would give you a control that is sometimes live and sometimes not, with no way
to tell which from looking at it. The admin page states the deferral at the
moment you change it and keeps a "restart required" band up until the restart
has happened.

The scan-size ceiling and the save-scan window are **not** deferred: they are
read per file, so they apply to the next file scanned. They tune a pipeline
that is already running; the three above decide whether it exists.

### Reaching a clamd container

```yaml
services:
  filex:
    environment:
      FILEX_CLAMAV_ADDR: "clamav:3310"
  clamav:
    image: clamav/clamav:latest
    volumes:
      - clamav-db:/var/lib/clamav
volumes:
  clamav-db:
```

The Protection page shows whether clamd actually answered (`reachable`, with
the error text beside it). ⚠ A daemon filex cannot reach never produces a clean
verdict — the scan fails and retries on the queue — but nothing would *say* so
without that field, so check it after changing an address.

### The editor save-scan window

A file **created** in filex's text editor is scanned immediately, exactly like
an upload. A **save** over a file that already exists schedules one scan
`FILEX_CLAMAV_SAVE_WINDOW_MINUTES` from now, and every further save inside that
window is absorbed into it — so a burst of Ctrl+S costs exactly one scan, and
that scan reads the file as it stands when it runs, not the content of the save
that scheduled it.

The trade is worth stating, because the default looks arbitrary otherwise: one
scan per file per half-hour of editing, paid for by the file sitting unscanned
for up to that long after its **last** save. Shorter means more scans and less
exposure; longer means fewer scans and more.

- **Minimum 2 minutes.** Below that the window stops coalescing anything — a
  save every couple of minutes is still one editing session — while multiplying
  scans.
- **Maximum 1 hour.** The window *is* the time an infected file written through
  the editor stays live. Longer is not a tuning preference, it is a different
  security posture.
- **`0` is not accepted.** It reads equally as "scan every save" and "never
  scan", which are opposite behaviours, and the second would silently re-open
  the gap this window lives inside. To turn scanning off, use the switch on the
  Protection page (`antivirus.enabled`), which is explicit about being a
  separate control and about applying at the next restart.

A value outside the range is **refused** when you save it on the Protection
page, so you find out while you are looking at the field. A value that is
somehow already stored out of range — written by hand, or by an older build —
is **clamped to the nearest bound on read**, with one WARN line naming the
value in force, rather than refusing to boot over a scan interval.

⚠ The delay is a row in filex's operation queue (`ops_queue.not_before`), not a
timer inside the process, so a restart or a deploy mid-window does not lose the
pending scan. Changing the window never rewrites scans already scheduled: they
keep the time they were given, and only scans scheduled afterwards use the new
value.

## Versioning on overwrite

Before any destructive-write surface replaces an existing file, it snapshots
the bytes being replaced into version history — and refuses the write rather
than let it through unrecorded when that snapshot cannot be taken. The full
per-surface list, including the two batch surfaces that skip a refused member
instead of failing the whole request, is in
[TRASH-VERSIONING.md](TRASH-VERSIONING.md#what-triggers-a-snapshot).

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_VERSIONS_ON_OVERWRITE` | `1` | Master switch for the pre-write snapshot guard. `0`/`false` turns it off for a deployment whose storage backend cannot afford the extra write — those writes then proceed unsnapshotted, exactly as they did before the guard existed, and filex logs one WARN at boot naming the state. `1`/`true` turns it back on, including over a `config.yaml` that set `versions_on_overwrite: false`: like every other boolean here, the env var wins in both directions. |
| `FILEX_VERSIONS_FAIL_OPEN` | `0` | Lets a snapshot **failure** fall through to the write instead of refusing it, logging `overwrite proceeding without a snapshot` (naming the storage and path) each time. Default off, because `Service.Snapshot`'s contract is that a caller must not proceed past a failed snapshot. It exists for one specific bind: if the object store fills up, snapshots start failing and the fail-closed default then refuses **every** overwrite on the instance — desktop sync, WebDAV, OnlyOffice saves, the browser. filex logs a WARN at boot while this is on, so the state is visible without reading the config. |

⚠ These are independent. `FILEX_VERSIONS_ON_OVERWRITE=0` skips the snapshot
attempt entirely; `FILEX_VERSIONS_FAIL_OPEN=1` still attempts it and still
records one when it succeeds. Note also that `versions.keep_n = 0` does **not**
disable versioning — `0` means "unlimited", and the snapshot path falls back to
its built-in retention default.

In `config.yaml`: `versions_on_overwrite: false` and `versions_fail_open: true`,
both top-level alongside `upload:` / `cache:`.

---

## Downloads from slow storage (prepared copies)

When a **big** file lives on a **slow** backend, filex fetches it to local disk
once, tells the user it is preparing (with a percentage), and then serves it —
and every later request — at local-disk speed, with full `Range` support. See
*Slow storage* in [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md).

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_CACHE` | `1` | Master switch. `0` disables prepared copies entirely. |
| `FILEX_CACHE_DIR` | `<data_dir>/cache` | Where prepared copies live. |
| `FILEX_CACHE_MIN_SIZE` | `67108864` (64 MiB) | Smallest file worth preparing. Below it, nothing is ever cached. |
| `FILEX_CACHE_MAX_BYTES` | `21474836480` (20 GiB) | **Global** ceiling on the cache directory, enforced with LRU eviction. |
| `FILEX_CACHE_SLOW_BPS` | `10485760` (10 MiB/s) | Measured throughput below which a storage counts as slow. |

A file is prepared only when it is **at least `MIN_SIZE`** *and* its storage is
slow — either flagged by you (`"slow": true` in the storage config) or measured
below `SLOW_BPS`. Small files, and files on storages that measure fast, are
served exactly as they were before: nothing is prepared and nobody waits.

> ⚠ The cap is not optional and cannot be set to "unlimited". When the cache is
> full of entries that are being read, a new file is simply **not** prepared and
> streams from the backend as before — filex will not exceed the ceiling to make
> room.

**The cache directory also holds folder-share ZIPs** (`<cache_dir>/sharezips`,
moved there from `<data_dir>/sharezips` on first start of v0.19.1+). They are
not covered by `FILEX_CACHE_MAX_BYTES`; they are bounded by their shares and by
two knobs of their own — an archive is deleted as soon as no active share can
serve it, and in any case after a week. See *Folder ZIPs are cached* in
[SHARING.md](SHARING.md).

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_SHAREZIP_WARM_MAX_BYTES` | `2147483648` (2 GiB) | Largest folder (sum of file sizes) the background warmer pre-builds. Bigger folders are zipped on demand when a visitor clicks, never refused. `0` = no ceiling. |
| `FILEX_SHAREZIP_MAX_AGE` | `7d` | A cached archive older than this is swept even if its share is still live, and rebuilt when next needed. Go durations plus a `d` suffix. `0` = keep for the share's life. |

⚠ **Exclude `<data_dir>/cache` from your backups.** Everything under it is
regenerable, and a single folder-share archive can be tens of gigabytes.

---

## Thumbnails

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_THUMBS_ENABLED` | `true` | Master switch. |
| `FILEX_THUMB_BACKFILL_ON_BOOT` | — | Set `once` to backfill missing thumbnails on startup. |
| `FILEX_THUMBS_SWEEP_INTERVAL` | `6h` | How often cached thumbnails whose node no longer exists are deleted (also once at boot). `0` disables it. |

Kinds and their tool requirements (auto‑detected on `PATH`; the full Docker
image bundles them): images = built‑in; video/audio = `ffmpeg`; PDF = `gs` or
`pdftoppm`; office = `libreoffice`; SVG = `rsvg-convert`. Missing tool → that
kind gets a generic placeholder card. Cache dir + formats are `config.yaml`
only (`thumbs.cache_dir`, `thumbs.formats`). See [thumbnails.md](thumbnails.md).

---

## Search

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_SEARCH_ENABLED` | `true` | Embedded Bleve full‑text index. |
| `FILEX_SEARCH_CONTENT` | `true` | Extract text from files into the index (content search). `0` stops enqueueing extraction; text already indexed keeps matching. |
| `FILEX_SEARCH_CONTENT_MAX` | `5242880` | Source files larger than this are never content‑extracted. |
| `FILEX_SEARCH_AUTO_REBUILD` | `true` | Rebuild the index in the background at startup when it was written by an older document schema. The replacement is built alongside the live index and swapped in, so search never goes dark. `0` leaves the index alone and reports `needs_rebuild` instead. |

Index path is `config.yaml` only (`search.index_path`, default
`<data_dir>/search.bleve`). See [SEARCH.md](SEARCH.md).

---

## AI assistant

The file assistant in the end-user app. Off unless an operator configures a
model provider — filex ships with no default provider and no key, and an
installation that has not configured one reports no assistant at all, so the
panel is never drawn.

All five settings live in the database and are **seeded** from these variables
on first boot only (see [Zero-touch seeding](#zero-touch-seeding)): once a row
exists, the variable is inert and the value is edited in the admin panel under
**AI assistant** (or through `PUT /api/admin/assistant/provider`). That screen
also holds the Test button — one real call to the provider, which is the only
thing that tells an operator the model name and the key actually work — and the
conversation list as metadata.

| Env var | Where it lives now | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_ASSISTANT_ENABLED` | **seed → database** (`assistant.enabled`) | off | The operator's switch. Off on a fresh install on purpose: nothing should start talking to a model provider because a key happened to be in the environment. |
| `FILEX_ASSISTANT_PROVIDER` | **seed → database** (`assistant.provider`) | `openai` | The wire protocol, not the vendor: `openai` is OpenAI *and* every openai-compatible server (vLLM, Ollama, LiteLLM, a gateway) — point `BASE_URL` at yours. `anthropic` is the Messages API. |
| `FILEX_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL` | **seed → database** (`assistant.base_url`) | unset | Absolute `http(s)` endpoint. Empty means the provider's own (`https://api.openai.com/v1`, `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`). A bare host is refused when you save it, not discovered at the first question. |
| `FILEX_ASSISTANT_MODEL` | **seed → database** (`assistant.model`) | unset | The model name, spelled the way your provider spells it. There is no default: it decides both the bill and the quality, and no software can guess it for you. |
| `FILEX_ASSISTANT_TURNS_PER_MINUTE` | **seed → database** (`assistant.turns_per_minute`) | `20` | The loop-breaker, per account. A person cannot type past it; an agent that has talked itself into a circle reaches it at once. Not a cost control. One turn at a time per account is enforced separately and is not configurable — a second concurrent turn would interleave two answers in one conversation. |
| `FILEX_ASSISTANT_API_KEY` | **seed → database, sealed** (`assistant.api_key`) | unset | The provider credential. It is encrypted with `FILEX_SECRET_KEY` before it is written and is never read back by any endpoint — the admin surface reports only *that* a key is stored. |

> ⚠⚠ **`FILEX_SECRET_KEY` is required to configure the assistant.** Without it
> the key cannot be sealed, and filex refuses to store it rather than writing a
> billable third-party credential into the database in the clear. The seed is
> skipped with a warning naming the variable. Rotating `FILEX_SECRET_KEY` makes
> the stored key unreadable; the admin surface then says so and asks for it to
> be re-entered, instead of reporting "not configured" next to a page that
> visibly holds one.

### What it can do

The full picture — every tool, the read gate, the plan mechanism and what the
assistant can never do at all — is its own page: **[AI assistant](ASSISTANT.md)**.
What an operator deciding whether to switch this on needs to know:

- **It looks, and it proposes.** It can list drives, list a folder, search by
  name and content, and list a file's versions, its public links and the trash.
- **Reading a file's CONTENTS needs the person's permission for that exact
  file**, given through a card in the panel and scoped to that one conversation.
  There is no wildcard and no "approve everything" — the schema has no column
  that could express one.
- **The model holds no tool that changes anything.** Its `plan_*` tools only
  write a plan — every item resolved to a node id and fingerprinted as it is at
  that moment — which the person reads and approves. The SERVER then executes
  what the stored plan says, without consulting the model again, so a prompt
  injection that talks the model into "delete everything" produces at worst a
  plan the person is looking at and can refuse.
- **Six kinds of plan exist and no others**: apply tags, move files into a
  folder, restore a version, create a public link, revoke a public link, empty
  the trash. The list with what approving each one does, and whether it can be
  undone, is kept in exactly one place —
  [what a plan may contain](ASSISTANT.md#what-a-plan-may-contain) — so that the
  two pages cannot drift apart. Two of the six are worth an operator's attention
  before switching this on: `move` rearranges live files (it never overwrites —
  a name already taken in the destination is skipped) and `create_share` mints a
  link anyone holding it can open **without an account**. Both are proposed only
  on a direct request, and both still go through the same plan card the person
  has to approve.
- **What is absent rather than gated** — no tool and no plan kind writes,
  renames or deletes a live file, uploads anything, changes anyone's
  permissions, or touches another account's anything:
  [what it cannot do at all](ASSISTANT.md#what-it-cannot-do-at-all).

Listing and searching are not gated: they return names, sizes and dates, which
is what the person already sees in their own file list.

One turn may call tools at most 8 times before it has to answer. That ceiling is
not configurable and is separate from `turns_per_minute`: this one stops a
single turn from going round in circles, the other stops a client from starting
turns in a loop.

Conversations are stored per account: private to their owner (an administrator
may see how many an account holds and delete one, and can read no line of any),
capped at 100 per account, and the least recently *active* one is evicted when
the cap is reached.

---

## Queue

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_QUEUE_DRIVER` | `sqlite` | `sqlite` · `postgres` · `redis` |
| `FILEX_QUEUE_DSN` | — | `postgres://…` or `redis://…` (ignored for sqlite — shares the app DB) |
| `FILEX_QUEUE_WORKERS` | `4` | Worker pool size. |
| `FILEX_QUEUE_ENABLED` | `true` | Disable to run without the persistent queue. |

Use **redis** or **postgres** for multi‑node deployments (postgres uses
`SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; redis keeps its pending set in a sorted set
and claims with a Lua script). sqlite is fine single‑node.

All three serve ops in the same order — `priority DESC`, then oldest first —
so a background sweep never overtakes a person's request whichever one you
run. ⚠ Switching **to** redis on an install that already ran the pre‑v0.34.0
redis driver converts its pending list on startup, keeping every queued op;
switching back to that older build afterwards will not work.

---

## Notifications

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_NOTIFY_ENABLED` | `true` | In‑app bell + webhook. |
| `FILEX_WEBHOOK_URL` | — | The **legacy single** webhook: one JSON POST per event, no event filter. Empty = in‑app only, plus whatever targets exist. |
| `FILEX_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` | — | Sent as `Authorization: Bearer` to that legacy webhook only. |

⚠ These two are not the whole notification surface, and have not been for
several releases: **webhook v2 targets** are rows managed in *Admin → Webhooks*,
each with its own URL, its own signing secret and its own **per‑event
allow‑list**. One event produces one POST per destination, not one POST. There
is no environment variable for them.

⚠ From v0.34.0 a write that **replaced** an existing file emits `file.updated`
rather than `file.uploaded` — a behaviour change for anyone already subscribed
to `file.uploaded` in order to see edits.

See [NOTIFICATIONS.md](NOTIFICATIONS.md).

---

## CORS

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `*` | Comma list. Restrict when embedding the component from specific origins. |

`allowed_methods` / `allowed_headers` are `config.yaml` only. Default allowed
headers: `Authorization, Content-Type, X-Filex-Pin`. If you use API‑token root
confinement from a browser, add `X-Filex-Token` / `X-Filex-Root`.

---

## Error reporting

Optional Sentry‑wire reporting (works with self‑hosted GlitchTip). Empty DSN =
off.

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_SENTRY_DSN` | — | Sentry/GlitchTip DSN. |
| `FILEX_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | — | Tag events (e.g. `production`). |

**What is reported.** filex does not sprinkle capture calls through the code;
it forwards its own log. Every `ERROR` record and every `WARN` record that
carries an `err` attribute becomes one event, grouped by the log message
(`thumb generate failed`, `ops: step failed`, …). `INFO` never reaches the
tracker — a listener closed by a shutdown, for instance, is an `INFO` line.

**Log attributes travel with the event.** Everything the log line carries —
`path`, `err`, `driver`, `attempt`, `storage`, `node`, … plus `source`
(`file.go:line` of the call site) — is attached twice:

- as **tags** when the value is short (first line, up to 120 characters), so
  the issue list and the tag filter show *which* file, driver or error;
- in full under the **`log` context** of the event (an ffmpeg transcript in
  `err` is kept whole there, untruncated).

Values whose key names a credential (`token`, `password`, `secret`,
`authorization`, `cookie`, `credential`, `private`, `*_key`, `key`) are
replaced with `[filtered]` before either. Log sites do not log secrets on
purpose, but a wrapped HTTP error or a config dump can carry one, and the key
is the cheapest reliable signal; an S3 object key is caught by the same rule —
the `path` beside it says the same thing.

---

## Updates

Release awareness and — on installs that own their binary — self-upgrade.
Full behaviour, including everything that is checked before anything is applied
automatically, is in [UPDATES.md](./UPDATES.md).

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_UPDATE_CHECK` | `1` | Master switch for the periodic check. `0` = no outbound request, ever. |
| `FILEX_UPDATE_POLICY` | `manual` | `off` · `manual` · `patch` · `minor` — how far filex may move on its own. The default announces only. |
| `AUTO_UPGRADE` | — | Shorthand for `FILEX_UPDATE_POLICY=patch` (z-moves apply themselves; y and x are announced). An explicit policy set afterwards wins. |
| `FILEX_UPDATE_CHANNEL` | `stable` | Release channel. |
| `FILEX_UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL` | `https://filex.sh/updates/stable.json` | Release index location — point it at your own mirror for air-gapped installs. |
| `FILEX_UPDATE_WINDOW` | — | Daily maintenance window for automatic upgrades, e.g. `03:00-05:00` (server local time). Empty = any time. |
| `FILEX_UPDATE_INTERVAL` | `24h` | Time between checks. Anything under `1h` is raised to `1h`. |
| `FILEX_UPDATE_PRE_COMMAND` | — | Shell command run immediately before a self-upgrade (database dump for postgres/mysql). **A non-zero exit aborts the upgrade.** sqlite is snapshotted by filex itself with `VACUUM INTO`. |
| `FILEX_INSTALL_MODE` | auto-detected | `binary` or `docker`, when detection is wrong for your setup. Container installs never self-apply — the image layer is immutable, so a replaced binary reverts at the next `up`. |

---

## Demo mode

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FILEX_DEMO_MODE` | `false` | Renders an "Open the demo" CTA on the login page. |
| `FILEX_DEMO_USER` | `demo@demo.com` | Demo credentials the CTA submits. |
| `FILEX_DEMO_PASS` | `demo` | (Keep the DB user in sync.) |

---

Some settings (branding, default thumbnail policy) live in the database
`settings` table and are managed from the admin UI, not here.

## Gotchas

- `FILEX_SYNC_DEFAULT_INTERVAL` is **not** read — the correct var is
  `FILEX_SYNC_INTERVAL`.
- `FILEX_SYNC_WORKERS` is **not** read either, and was removed in v0.20: there
  is no worker pool to size. See [Storage sync](#storage-sync).
- ⚠⚠ **`FILEX_CLAMAV*` are seeds, not overrides.** Every one of them except
  `FILEX_CLAMAV_BIN` is read on a boot where its setting has no stored row yet,
  and never again — so once filex has booted once, editing the variable and
  restarting **changes nothing, silently**, because a setting that already has a
  value is not unusual and nothing warns. The stored values are edited on
  *Settings → Protection*. See [Antivirus (ClamAV)](#antivirus-clamav).
- `FILEX_DEFAULT_STORAGE_*` only takes effect on a **fresh** install (it seeds a
  default storage when none exists yet); it never edits or replaces an existing
  storage. See [Zero‑touch seeding](#zero-touch-seeding).
- Booleans accept only `"1"` / `"true"`; anything else is false.
- LDAP and proxy‑header now have env vars (`FILEX_LDAP_*` / `FILEX_HEADER_*`); the
  env value overrides the matching `config.yaml` field.
- `FILEX_INSTALLATION_*` settings are frozen after the first boot and make filex
  refuse to start if they change — that is deliberate, not a bug. The single
  exception is turning escrow **on**, which can be
  [adopted](#adopting-escrow-later) with `FILEX_INSTALLATION_E2E_ESCROW_ADOPT=1`
  and is not retroactive. See
  [Install-time settings](#install-time-settings-filex_installation_).
