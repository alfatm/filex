// Puts the `filex` CLI into build/bin so electron-builder can ship it.
//
// The CLI is the sync engine — the app has no transfer code of its own — so a
// package without it is a package that silently syncs nothing. This script
// therefore FAILS the build rather than quietly producing one.
//
// ⚠ This copy is built WITHOUT the embedded server UI. `filex` normally carries
// the admin SPA inside it so `filex serve` can host it; that is 85 MB, and the
// desktop app already ships exactly those files in app/. Bundling the full
// binary put a second copy of the same interface in every installer: measured
// 156 MB against 45 MB for this one. What the app uses — `filex sync` and
// `filex client` — is identical either way; only `serve` (which nobody runs out
// of an app's resources folder) would come up without a UI.
//
// Source order:
//   1. $FILEX_CLI_BIN — an already-built binary (what CI passes in).
//   2. A local `go build` of ../backend, if Go is available.
//
// Run: node scripts/fetch-cli.mjs [--platform win32|linux|darwin]
