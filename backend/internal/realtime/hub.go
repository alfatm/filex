	// ── change coalescing ──────────────────────────────────────────────
	//
	// One folder can be changed far more often than a listing is worth
	// re-fetching. Two shapes were measured on 2026-09-06:
	//
	//   - one NFS write = 3-6 frames. NFSv3 has no "close", so go-nfs opens,
	//     writes and CLOSES the handle for EVERY write RPC (nfs_onwrite.go),
	//     and filex commits + announces on each close. `cp -p` of a 5 MB file
	//     over a real mount: 1 CREATE + 5 × 1 MiB WRITE = 6 frames.
	//   - extracting a 5 000-file zip = 5 000 frames, one per member.
	//
	// The room therefore emits on the LEADING edge — the first change in a
	// quiet room goes out with nothing added to it, because the latency of an
	// ordinary single write is the number this whole layer exists to protect —
	// and merges everything that follows into one trailing frame per `window`.
	// `window` starts at coalesceMin and doubles per flush up to coalesceMax,
	// so a short burst settles almost at once while a long one costs a bounded
	// trickle instead of thousands of frames. It resets the moment a change
	// arrives into a room that has gone quiet.
	//
	// ⚠ pending is never dropped, only merged: the flush that ends a burst
	// carries the burst's last event, so an explorer's final re-list sees the
	// final state. A burst that ended with a silently discarded frame would
	// leave that folder stale until the person navigated away and back.
