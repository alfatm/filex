// see `invoice 2026` find `invoice_2026.pdf` exactly like everybody
// else. A LIKE cannot do that on its own — `%invoice 2026%` matches no
// filename that used a different separator, which is the whole bug from
// issue #15 — and the store's SearchNodes takes ONE pattern, so the
// separator-blind part happens in two steps:
//
//  1. Like is the single most selective word, sent to the database.
//  2. Accepts re-checks the FULL query against each returned row in
//     normalised form, so the remaining words still have to match.
//
// What the fallback deliberately does NOT get is typo tolerance: edit
// distance is not something a LIKE can express, and faking it with more
// patterns would turn one scan into many. Said out loud in
// docs/SEARCH.md rather than left for somebody to discover.
