// Forgiving filename matching: separator-blind normalisation, multi-word
// wildcards, typo tolerance, an explicit ranking contract, and the
// `tag:` query filter.
//
// Motivated by issue #15, which reported that `main go` did not find
// `main.go`. Measuring it turned up something narrower and stranger than
// the report: single words always worked, and `main go` / `foo bar`
// already worked, while `invoice 2026` did not find `invoice_2026.pdf`.
// The reason is tokenisation, not the number of words. Bleve's standard
// analyzer splits `invoice_2026.pdf` into [invoice_2026, pdf] — an
// underscore JOINS — and `foo-bar.txt` into [foo, bar.txt] — a hyphen
// SPLITS. So which separator the file happened to use decided whether the
// search worked, a distinction no user can predict.
//
// The fix is to stop letting the analyzer decide: every name and every
// query is normalised to the same separator-blind form before it reaches
// the index, so `.`, `-`, `_` and a space are all the same character.
