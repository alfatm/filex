// Package writehook is the single post-write side-effect gate for every
// file-producing/mutating surface (manager, AI/MCP, ShareX, DAV, async
// ops worker).
//
// A surface that writes/deletes/moves a file calls exactly ONE hook
// here; the hook fans out to the two cross-cutting side effects that
// used to be wired ad hoc per call site:
//
//   - async antivirus scan enqueue ("Koru" ClamAV pipeline) — only for
//     persisted file nodes (the scan job re-reads the node by id);
//   - canonical webhook-v2 file event (file.uploaded / file.updated /
//     file.deleted / file.moved / file.trashed) through the notify
//     service, stamped with the originating surface in meta.origin.
//
// The package is dependency-injected at bootstrap (Configure in
// api.BuildRouter) with the same nil-safe, package-level sink pattern
// as handlers.SetNotifySink / SetAntivirusEnqueue: unconfigured hooks
// are no-ops, so tests and unwired deployments never crash. It imports
// only auth/model/notify — no handlers, db, or storage — so any surface
// package (api/handlers, dav, …) can import it without a cycle.
