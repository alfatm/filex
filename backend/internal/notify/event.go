// Package notify is filex' notification subsystem.
//
// Two delivery channels:
//   - Webhook: a single configurable POST endpoint that always receives
//     a generic JSON body. Retry 3× exponential backoff.
//   - In-app:  per-user bell + history + read/unread, surfaced via the
//     /api/notifications/... endpoints. Persisted in the notifications
//     table so they survive a server restart.
//
// Both channels fan out from one Service.Send call. The webhook URL +
// optional bearer token come from FILEX_WEBHOOK_URL / FILEX_WEBHOOK_TOKEN
// (.env bootstrap) or DB-stored override (notification_settings tabular
// override is per-user; the webhook URL itself is global, stored in the
// settings table). v0.1 reads them from config; the admin panel exposes
// PATCH /admin/api/notifications/webhook-config to change them at runtime.

// ⚠ This const block is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the subscribable
// event catalogue. The rule is mechanical: an EventType whose value contains
// a dot is a webhook-v2 event an operator can tick in the admin UI, and the
// admin UI's list must match this block exactly. Two tests hold that:
//
//   - catalog_test.go here refuses an inline notify.EventType("x.y")
//     anywhere in the backend, so a new event cannot be born outside this
//     block (that is how "e2e.escrow_used" existed for a release without
//     ever reaching the UI);
//   - web/tests/webhooks/eventCatalog.test.ts parses this file and fails
//     when web/src/lib/webhookEvents.ts drifts from it, or when an event is
//     missing an operator-readable label in en.json or tr.json.
//
// The older underscore-named alerts above (replica_fail, disk_full, …) are
// operational alarms from the pre-v2 global webhook; MatchesEvent will still
// filter on them if a target names one, but they are not part of the catalogue
// the UI offers.
