// Package metrics is filex's Prometheus surface.
//
// There was none before this: `grep -r prometheus` over the whole repo found
// only the plan that asked for it. So this package defines the exposition
// rather than matching an existing one, and everything it publishes is named
// `filex_*`.
//
// # Where it is served
//
// `GET /metrics`, behind the SAME admin gate as every other operator endpoint
// (`auth.Middleware(true)` + `auth.RequireAdmin`). filex is a file server that
// is routinely exposed to the internet, and an open /metrics leaks storage
// names, user counts and traffic shape. A Prometheus job therefore scrapes it
// with an admin session/token; `docs/METRICS.md` shows the scrape config.
//
// # What is instrumented, and why exactly this
//
// The list is the shortest one that answers the questions an operator actually
// asks when uploads on slow storage go wrong:
//
//   - "is anything stuck?"      → staged uploads in flight, and their age
//   - "did it get worse?"       → commits vs. failures vs. retries
//   - "is the backend slow?"    → transfer duration + rolling bytes/sec
//   - "why was I refused?"      → guard counters, one per guard
//   - "is the disk filling?"    → staged bytes, sweeper removals
//   - "who is using the space?" → total quota usage, refusals
//
// Nothing here is on a hot loop: counters are incremented once per upload,
// per commit or per refusal, and the two derived gauges are computed at scrape
// time from in-memory state.
