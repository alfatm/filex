// ─────────────────────── thumbnail cache reclamation ───────────────────────
//
// Every generator writes `<cacheDir>/<node id>.jpg`. Until this file existed
// nothing ever removed one: not a delete, not a purge from the trash, not
// removing the whole storage. The `thumbnails` ROW went away with the node
// (ON DELETE CASCADE) but the JPEG stayed, so a data directory only ever grew
// and an operator watching a podman volume saw exactly what issue #18 reported
// — the objects gone from S3, the bytes still on disk.
//
// Two mechanisms, and the second one is the guarantee:
//
//   - Forget: called at the moment a node is destroyed for good, so the space
//     comes back when the user asks for it rather than at the next sweep;
//   - ReapOrphans: a reconciler that repairs an install which has been leaking
//     since v0.1 — including every path Forget does not sit on, and every
//     orphan already on disk before this code shipped.
//
// # Why this cannot delete a live thumbnail
//
// Deleting cached bytes is destructive, so the rule is narrow on purpose. A
// file is removed only when ALL of these hold:
//
//  1. its name matches `<digits>.jpg` exactly — nothing else in the directory
//     is ever a candidate;
//  2. the database POSITIVELY reports that node id absent from `nodes`. A
//     trashed node still has a row, so a file in the trash keeps its thumbnail
//     and a restore is instant. A query error aborts the pass without deleting
//     anything: "I could not ask" is never read as "it is gone";
//  3. node ids are monotonic (`AUTOINCREMENT` on SQLite, `BIGSERIAL` on
//     Postgres) and never reused, so an id that is absent today cannot acquire
//     a referent tomorrow;
//  4. the file has not been touched within a grace window, so a thumbnail being
//     written right now is never judged mid-flight.

var thumbFileRe = regexp.MustCompile(`^([0-9]+)\.jpg$`)

// reapGrace is how recently a cached file may have been written and still be
// protected. Generation writes the JPEG before the "ready" row is upserted, so
// this covers the window between the two even for a node created in the same
// instant.
const reapGrace = 10 * time.Minute

// Forget removes one node's cached thumbnail — the JPEG and the row.
//
// Call it where a node is destroyed permanently (trash purge, retention
// expiry, a hard delete on a driver that cannot preserve bytes). It is NOT for
// a soft delete: a trashed file is restorable and keeps its thumbnail.
//
// Best-effort by design: a thumbnail is a cache, and failing to remove one must
// never fail the deletion it is attached to. Every failure is logged.

// rebuilds it: one storage when storageID > 0, the whole installation when 0.
// It returns how many rows were cleared.
//
// This is the admin-triggered counterpart to ReapOrphans. The sweeper only
// removes what no node claims any more; Reset deliberately removes thumbnails
// of files that are very much alive — because the cached bytes can be WRONG
// rather than merely stale. An image built without ffmpeg/ghostscript on PATH
// caches a placeholder card for every video and PDF, in state="ready", and
// "ready" is the one state a backfill never re-runs. Nothing short of dropping
// the row gets a real preview onto the grid afterwards.
//
// ⚠ Rows go first, files second. The reverse order has a crash window that
// leaves a "ready" row pointing at a JPEG that is gone — a thumbnail no
// backfill will ever rebuild. With the row gone first, a leftover file is
// simply overwritten by the next generation for that node.
