// Package quotastore is the single place where per-user storage usage is
// accounted. It wraps a db.Store and keeps `users.usage_bytes` in step with
// the node rows, so every write surface — browser upload, staged upload,
// staged ingest, WebDAV PUT, the public file drop, ShareX, the AI/REST API,
// save-text, archive extract, copy — is counted without any of them knowing
// that quotas exist.
//
// # Why here, and not in nine handlers
//
// Before this package, `quota.AddUsage` and `Store.SetNodeOwner` had no
// callers anywhere in the tree: `usage_bytes` was never incremented,
// `GetNodeOwner` always returned nil, and the `SubUsage` at trash-purge —
// the only call site — therefore never ran either. Nothing was counted, so
// nothing was ever refused, and the two features standing on this (chunk 4's
// quota reservation at `begin`, and "trashed bytes still count against
// quota") were theory.
//
// The write surfaces do not share a funnel: `writehook` comes closest, but it
// fires AFTER the row is already updated, so the previous size — the thing an
// overwrite delta needs — is gone by then, and it deliberately imports no db
// package. What every surface DOES share is the store: a node's bytes cannot
// begin, change or stop existing without `CreateNode`, `UpdateNodeMeta` or
// `HardDeleteNode`. Wrapping those three is therefore the one place that is
// both complete and future-proof — a write path added next month is counted
// on the day it is written, with no line of its own.
//
// The pattern is the one internal/tenantstore already uses: embed db.Store,
// override the handful of methods that matter, pass everything else through.
//
// # The rule (docs/QUOTAS.md is the prose version)
//
//	usage_bytes(u) == SUM(nodes.size) WHERE owner_id=u AND type='file'
//	                  — trashed rows INCLUDED
//	usage_files(u) == COUNT(*)        WHERE owner_id=u AND type='file'
//	                  — the same rows, counted instead of summed (00042)
//
// Everything else follows from that identity:
//
//   - bytes land   → owner set, size added
//   - overwrite    → the delta is applied; on a user-attributed write the
//     owner becomes the writer, so old owner -= old size and
//     new owner += new size
//   - trash        → nothing (the bytes still exist and still count)
//   - restore      → nothing (they never stopped counting)
//   - move/rename  → nothing (same row, same owner, same bytes)
//   - copy         → a new row, so the bytes are counted again — they are
//     genuinely a second copy on the disk
//   - purge / permanent delete → subtracted, because the bytes are gone
//
// # Attribution
//
// The owner is the acting identity, resolved in this order:
//
//  1. an explicit owner put on the context with WithOwner — used by surfaces
//     with no logged-in user whose bytes still belong to someone (the public
//     file-drop link bills the link's creator; the async copy worker bills
//     the owner of the source file);
//  2. auth.UserFrom(ctx) — every authenticated surface, including WebDAV
//     Basic auth and AI/REST tokens;
//  3. nobody. A node discovered by the storage scanner was not uploaded by
//     anyone, so it stays unowned and uncounted — until a user overwrites it,
//     at which point it becomes theirs.
