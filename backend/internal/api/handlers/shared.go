// unless they were told the path. That is the one item on a Drive-style

// SharedWithMe lists the items the caller holds a grant on, newest grant
// first, paginated with ?limit= (default 100, max 500) and ?offset=.
//
// Four decisions worth stating, because each of them is a place where the
// obvious implementation is wrong:
//
//  1. A grant on a FOLDER lists the folder itself, not its contents. That is
//     what the explorer needs: the row is a `dir` whose `path` is
//     adapter-qualified, so opening it navigates into the folder through the
//     ordinary listing endpoint (which applies the same grants again). Listing
//     the contents here would flatten the tree and make the row unopenable.
//
//  2. "Does not own" is expressed the way filex actually models ownership.
//     There is no per-node owner: `nodes.owner_id` exists for quota accounting
//     only and is nil for everything a sync discovered. What separates "shared
//     with me" from "mine" is where the access comes from — on an RBAC-off
//     storage every authenticated user already reaches everything by role, so
//     a grant row there is inert and the items are not "shared", they are just
//     the user's files. Hence: RBAC-enabled storages only.
//
//  3. A grant with an empty path_prefix is a whole-storage grant. It is not
//     listed as an item (its name would be empty); it is what makes the
//     storage appear in `storages` below — the "shared drive" that the panel
//     shows in its storage list rather than as a file row.
//
//  4. Tenancy is filtered explicitly, not assumed. tenantstore wraps exactly
//     three methods, and per-grant reads are not among them, so an unfiltered
//     listing here would hand a tenant the names and paths of another tenant's
//     shared folders — the same cross-tenant leak the search handler filters
//     out at handlers/search.go. Filtering only in ListEnabledStorages would
//     be filtering in a place the test harness does not even wrap.
