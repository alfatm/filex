// Upload tickets exist for the one file an agent CANNOT hand to filex: a large
// local one. Every agent-facing write surface here — /api/ai/upload's JSON
// body, the MCP file_write tool — carries its bytes inside the call itself, so
// on an MCP transport those bytes travel through the model's context. A 130 MB
// file is ~173 MB of base64 there: not slow, impossible. The agent is left
// telling its user "I can't upload this", which is exactly what happened for an
// hour with one spreadsheet (2026-08-27).
//
// A ticket splits the operation in two: the AUTHORIZED call (mint) resolves and
// pins the destination under the caller's own token, and the UNAUTHENTICATED
// transfer (redeem) streams the bytes straight to storage over plain HTTP:
//
//	agent → POST /api/ai/upload/ticket {"path":"s3://…/big.xlsx"}   (its token)
//	      ← {"url":"https://fm.example.com/u/<ticket>", "expires_at":…}
//	agent → curl -T big.xlsx <url>                                   (no token)
//	      ← {"entry":{…}}
//
// The redeem URL needs no credentials ON PURPOSE: the agent that must run the
// upload frequently has no filex token (a Coder workspace, a fleet agent), and
// handing it one to copy a file would be a far worse trade. What keeps that
// safe is that the ticket is not a credential for filex — it is a credential
// for ONE write:
//
//   - the destination is fixed at mint time and the redeemer cannot name a path
//   - it grants no read, no list, no delete — nothing but that one write
//   - it is single-use (a successful write consumes it) and short-lived
//   - the bytes are billed to and written as the MINTER, not the redeemer
//
// Tickets live in memory only. They are minutes-lived by design, so a restart
// dropping them costs a re-mint (one MCP call) and buys us no schema change.
