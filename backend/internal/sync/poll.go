//
//   - a real trashed item that the walk UN-DELETED, because it found the
//     object at the row's own retagged key and read "the catalogue does not
//     know about this file". That is the deletion undoing itself, and for a
//     quarantined file it is the security control expiring. It is put back:
//     soft-deleted, keeping the retagged path and the original path in
//     storage_key, so trash restore and retention purge work on it again.
//
//   - a row the walk CREATED for the trash's own bytes (the bucket directory,
//     and the contents of a trashed folder, which already have retagged rows
//     of their own). Those are duplicates that also carry a search-index
//     document each, since the walk indexes what it creates. They are dropped
//     outright, bytes untouched -- the retagged row is the one that owns them.
//     ⚠ The bucket row is the dangerous one, and only becomes dangerous now
//     that the walk skips the trash: unseen, the tombstone pass soft-deletes
//     it, and it lands in the trash listing as a DIRECTORY entry whose path is
//     `/.filex-trash`. Purging that runs purgeDirDescendants over the
//     `/.filex-trash/` prefix -- every trashed row on the storage -- and then
//     asks the driver to delete the directory itself.
//
// ⚠ The distinction is storage_key. A trashed row keeps the path the file came
// from; a row the walk minted in the trash points at itself. Hard-deleting the
// first kind would destroy a restorable deletion; soft-deleting the second
// would put a phantom in the trash listing whose purge would delete the trash
// directory itself.

// confirmGone decides whether a node the walk did not see may be moved to
// trash.
//
// ⚠⚠ Absence from a listing is NOT proof that the user's file was deleted, and
// answering it with "move to trash" is how a bug in an unrelated part of filex
// becomes data loss. In issue #16 every staged upload above 8 MiB failed to
// reach S3 (the commit could not sign a non-seekable part body), the node stayed
// in the catalogue with its bytes still in staging, and the next sync run — doing
// exactly what it was told — read "this node is not in the bucket" and trashed
// the file the user had just uploaded and been shown as complete. The upload bug
// is fixed, but the shape recurs on its own: a permissions change that hides a
// prefix, a driver that pages a listing badly, an object restored to a bucket
// out of band. So the tombstone pass now has to be RIGHT about the deletion, not
// merely unable to see the file.
//
// Two questions, both of which must say "yes, it is really gone":
//
//  1. Did filex ever put the bytes there? A node whose transfer_state is not
//     "stored" has never been confirmed on the backend — it is either mid-flight
//     or a failed upload whose bytes are still in staging. The backend not
//     listing it is the EXPECTED state, not evidence of a deletion, and it is
//     never a reason to trash it. (This also closes the race in which a sync run
//     lands between publishing the node and the commit finishing, which would
//     trash a perfectly healthy upload.)
//
//  2. Does the object really not exist? A listing can omit an object for reasons
//     that have nothing to do with deletion. Stat is a direct, cheap second
//     opinion and it only runs for candidates. Only a definite ErrNotFound is
//     taken as deletion; any other error (permissions, timeout, 503) keeps the
//     node, because "I could not check" must never read as "it is gone".
