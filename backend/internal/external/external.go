// Package external is the one place the runtime asks "how is OnlyOffice /
// drawio / the converters configured right now?".
//
// # Why this exists
//
// Before it, the answer came from two places that could not agree. The admin
// UI wrote `external_services` rows and the capability probe read them, so
// `GET /api/files/capabilities` — the thing the explorer consults to decide
// whether to offer the Office editor at all — reported the operator's edit
// immediately. But the code that USES the configuration read
// `cfg.ExternalServices`, a snapshot taken from env/YAML once at boot: the
// OnlyOffice service was constructed (or not) in server.New, and the converter
// URL was baked into the AI handlers in routes.go. An operator who configured
// the services in the admin UI — the documented way, and the only way when the
// services live in a separate compose file — therefore got a green Test button,
// a capability payload that said "configured", and a 503
// `{"error":"onlyoffice not configured"}` the moment they opened a document
// (issue #17). Thumbnails kept working throughout, because the thumbnailer
// shelled out to local binaries and never consulted external services at all —
// that asymmetry is what named the bug. It is gone: office thumbnails now
// resolve their converter (`libreoffice`) from here, per call, for the same reason.
//
// # The rule
//
// The DB row is the single runtime source of truth. Env/YAML is declarative
// configuration for it: a non-empty value is ASSERTED onto the row at every
// boot (see server.seedExternalDefaults), so a compose-managed install keeps
// behaving exactly as before and an edit to FILEX_ONLYOFFICE_URL still takes
// effect. Anything env does not pin is owned by the admin UI and applies live,
// with no restart.
