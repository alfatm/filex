// Package sharezip caches the ZIP archive produced when a shared FOLDER is
// downloaded ("download all"). Without a cache, every download re-walks the
// folder and re-reads + re-compresses every file from object storage — slow for
// large folders (e.g. a receipt month with hundreds of images). The cache is
// keyed by node id + a content signature (file set + sizes + mtimes), so any
// change to the folder invalidates it and the next request (or the background
// warmer) regenerates.
//
// A small in-memory generation registry deduplicates concurrent builds: if a
// zip for a given signature is already being generated (by another download or
// by the warmer), other callers attach to the same job and can watch its
// progress instead of kicking off a second build.
//
// # Nothing outlives its share
//
// A cached archive exists to serve one folder share. When that share expires,
// is revoked or runs out of downloads, the archive is garbage — regenerable
// garbage — and Sweep deletes it on the warmer's next pass. A build in flight
// for a share that dies mid-build stops and takes its partial file with it
// (shareGone). Both read the same view of active shares, ActiveShares, so
// "active" means one thing in this package.
